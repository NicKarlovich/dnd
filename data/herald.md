# Herald
##### Version: *v0.4.1* 
## Base Herald Class

To begin upon the path of herald, you must be chosen by a spren.  The spren for each order is different, but they are the beings that grant you your powers.  These powers that your spren bequeath to you, must be unlocked by speaking a series of five Ideals.  These five ideals are often powerful statements of purpose and dedication which align your goals with those of your order.

All orders speak the same first ideal, but the second, third, fourth, and fifth ideals are unique for each order.  Additionally, some orders don't require you to speak exactly the same words for each ideal, as long as the intent behind the words you speak match the goals of the ideal.

Together the heralds act as a coalaition of knights, often called the Radiant Knights, who embody different ideals, but ultimately work together to protect the world.

### Basic Features:
Hit Points, Proficiencies, and Equipment are based on your [Radiant Order](#radiant-order)

### Spren
A spren is a being who chooses you as a creature to trust.  They allow you to use their power if you speak the ideals of they order they represent.  Each Radiant Order requires a different spren, and the spren of your order is listed in the table below.

A spren is an creature who grants you your powers.  Spren can be material or immaterial, and visible or invisible to you and/or others.  You should talk to your DM about what your spren would look like in their world.  Additionally, you should decide how much they will integrate into the story.  There are multiple ways you and your DM could roleplay the spren.  A spren could be a major character whom you talk to often and could have deep interesting personalities.  Conversely, if an additional constant NPC is too much work for your DM (which is completely valid), they could be realized as a spirit that lives within your shardblade speaking to you only when you speak your ideals, and remaining silent or speaking only when spoken to.  Or possibly, maybe you never see them at all and they come to you in your dreams and speak telepathically to you, but they have no visual manifestation.

Regardless, spren manifestations (other than as a shardblade) are not intended to give any tactical advantages, ie combat/scouting/distraction etc.[^herald1]  The subclasses are balanced around the assumption that they are for lore and roleplay reasons only.

Seriously, make sure to talk to your DM before playing your Herald to ensure that you are both on the same page about what to expect in terms of story and roleplay from your spren.

### Radiant Order
In becoming a Knight Radiant you must decide your order.  When you decide your order you agree to dedicate yourself completely to your order.  This means if you take levels in herald you are not allowed to deviate from your order and multiclass.  Additionally, if you have levels in another class you cannot take levels in herald until you lose the levels in the other class(es).
Your choice grants you additional capabilities when you choose it at 1st level.  As you progress along your order you will swear five ideals, at 3rd, 6th, 9th, 13th, and 18th level.  

Each order also has an ability score, tool and spren, each of which are used to enhance, diversify, and showcase the themes and specializations between each order.

### Stormlight
At 1st level, although you have not sworn the first ideal, as a future member of the Radiant Knights you have the innate ability to absorb and retain stormlight in your body.  Stormlight is a powerful fuel source that allows Radiant Knights to perform their legendary feats.  Your access to stormlight is represented by a number of stormlight charges.  Your herald level determines the number of charges you have, as shown in the Stormlight Charges column of the Herald Table. 

When you expend a stormlight charge, it is unavailable until you finish a long rest, at the end of which you gain all of your expended stormlight charges.

#### Stormlight Veins:
As an action, you can conceal and reveal the stormlight that flows through your veins.  When you reveal your Stormlight Veins, you emit a muted blue light from your skin which emanates bright light for 5 feet and dim light for an additional 5 feet.  When it is concealed, no light is visible.

When you reach 7th level, your understanding and comfort with stormlight means you no longer require air to breathe.

When you reach 14th level, stormlight constantly flows through your veins enhancing your every move.  You gain advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.

### Stormlight Restoration:
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to knit wounds and repair damage to yourself using the Stormlight you absorb.  As a bonus action, you can expend any number of stormlight charges to restore a number of hit points to yourself.  You restore 2 hit points per charge that you expend.

When you reach 10th level, you can expend 5 stormlight charges to cure yourself of any poison or disease, or you can expend 8 stormlight to cure yourself of 1 level of exhaustion

### First Ideal:
At 3rd level you begin your path to becoming a fully fledged Knight Radiant and will begin speaking the Immortal Words.  The First Ideal is the same for all orders, but they will vary as you swear the greater ideals at higher levels.  Your order's ideals and abilities are based on your [Radiant Order](#radiant-order).

The following is the first ideal which officially begins you on your path towards becoming a Radiant Knight:

>*Life before death.  Strength before weakness.  Journey before destination.*  

### Shardblade
At 3rd level, the bond you have with spren has evolved to the point where you gain the ability to summon them in the material plane.  You can use your interact object to summon your Shardblade in your empty hand.  You can choose the form that this weapon takes each time you create it.  The form of the weapon must be a weapon with which you are proficient.  Additionally, this weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.  

If the weapon is one that requires ammunition, it magically creates ammunition if you don't provide your own.  If you make a thrown weapon attack with a shardblade, the weapon immediately reappears back in one of your empty hands regardless of the outcome of the attack.

Your Shardblade disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more.  It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

#### Absorb Magic Weapon
You also gain the ability to absorb magic weapons which you are proficient with and meld them into your shardblade.  You can absorb a magic weapon into your shardblade by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.  You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way.  Once completed, when you summon your shardblade, you can instead choose to summon the magical weapon you absorbed which acts as your shardblade.  This absorbed weapon gains the benefits of being Awakened/Ascendant/Exalted.  You can dismiss this weapon into an extradimensional space as if it were your shardblade.  You can only absorb one magical weapon at a time. The magical weapon ceases to be absorbed by your shardblade if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. 

#### Awakened Shardblade 
At 7th level you become more attuned with your spren and your Shardblade becomes more responsive to your commands.  Any weapon you summon with your Shardblade feature has a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is an absorbed weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.

#### Ascendant Shardblade
At 11th level your bond with your spren has grown significantly.  Any weapon you summon with your Shardblade feature has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls, unless it is an absorbed weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.

#### Exalted Shardblade
At 15th level your bond with your spren has grown significantly.  Any weapon you summon with your Shardblade feature has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, unless it is an absorbed weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Font of Stormlight
Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain a number of stormlight charges, up to your maximum, equal to your [Order Modifier](#radiant-order) + your proficiency bonus when you finish a short rest.

<!-- ## Second Ideal
Your dedication towards your ideal grows stronger within you.  The powers gained from your Second Ideal is based on your [Radiant Order](#radiant-order) -->

<!-- ## Awakened Shardblade
At 7th level you become more attuned with your spren and your Shardblade becomes more responsive to your commands.  Any weapon you create with your Shardblade feature has a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. -->

<!-- ## Third Ideal
When you reach 9th level, the words come to you, possibly in a moment of desparation or introspection.  Regardless of how it occurs your adherence to your order grants you additional powers according to your [Radiant Order](#radiant-order) -->

<!-- ## Superior Shardblade
At 11th level your bond with your spren has grown significantly.  Any weapon you create with your Shardblade feature has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. -->

<!-- ## Fourth Ideal
When you reach 13th level, you achieve a level of dedication to your order that few ever reach, you become a source of inspiration for others in your order.  For your great achievement you gain additional powers according to your [Radiant Order](#radiant-order) -->

### Expertise
At 6th level, choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen proficiency.  Additionally you gain expertise in your [Radiant Order's](#radiant-order) Tool.

<!-- ## Exalted Shardblade
At 15th level your bond with your spren has grown significantly.  Any weapon you create with your Shardblade feature has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. -->

### Unbreakable Bond
At 17th level, the connection you have with your spren transcends the material plane, allowing you to tether your life essence to the mortal realm when typically it would fade.  When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can choose to instead go to 1 hit point.  Additionally you can expend any number of remaining stormlight charges you have, gaining 2 temporary hit points per charge.  After 1 minute, the temporary hit points are removed.

Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

<!-- ## Fifth Ideal
When you reach 18th level, you become the Herald of your order.  You are the epitome of your Ideal and to unlock the fifth ideal is something truely legendary.  When you swear your fifth and final ideal and become the herald of your order you gain a powerful boon according to your [Radiant Order](#radiant-order) -->

### Stormlight Regeneration
When you reach 20th level, your connection to the material plane is unmatched you have unlocked total mastery over stormlight.  So much so that it is naturally drawn to you.  Every 5 minutes, you regain 1 stormlight charge up to your maximum.

Additionally, while your heart and brain are connected, you can regrow any amputated limbs at a rate of 2lb of flesh per minute.

## Windrunner Order
The windrunner order primarily represents protecting anyone and everyone that they can.  Their ability to fly with ease allows them to work as scouts and to easily escort other heralds across the world very quickly.  Their skills tend to include using their gravitational lashings and adhesion abilities to effortlessly fly through the air, and maniuplate projectiles and weapons.

### Spren
As a windrunner, the spren you bond with is an Honorspren.  They are the children of Honor, an ancient being which embodied oaths, agreements and binding truths to those who swear them.  Spren typically appear as ribbons of glowing white-blue light.  They generally prefer a humanoid form, although typically only about a handspan tall, but they can grow to be as a large as a regular person.

### Hit Points
*1st-level Windrunner feature*

* **Hit Die:** 1d10 per windrunner level

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.

### Windrunner DC
*1st-level Windrunner feature*

Some Windrunner abilities and spells will require your Windrunner DC which is calculated as 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.

### Weapon Mastery
*1st-level Windrunner feature*  

Your training as a windrunner allows you to use the Mastery property of two kinds of weapons which you are proficient with.  Whenever you level up, you can change the weapons that you have mastery with.  You gain an additional weapon mastery at 4th and 10th level.

### Windrunner Fighting Style:
*1st-level Windrunner feature*

As windrunners are naturally protectors, you automatically gain the *Dexterous Protector* fighting style.  

**Dexterous Protector:** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.  Additionally, you can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attacks and damage rolls of weapons that you are proficient with through the Windrunner class.

Additionally, at 1st level, you adopt a style of fighting as your speciality.  Choose one of the following options.  You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Defense:** You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Improved Interception:** When you use your *Dexterous Protector* fighting style feature but the creature you protect is still hit by the attack, you can reduce the damage the creature takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this feature.
* **Skylancer:** On your turn, if you are under the effects of your [Basic Lashing](#basic-lashing) and you make an attack with a skylance, you can regain 1 stormlight charge.  Additionally on your turn, you can disengage from the creature you target with your skylance (no action required).  Finally, if you use [Stormlight Tempo](#stormlight-tempo) before making an attack with a skylance, each charge you expend adds an additional damage dice to your skylance attack instead of allowing extra attacks.[^windrunner1]
<!-- * <sup><a id="windrunner4b" href="#windrunner4">[4]</a></sup> -->
* **Superior Technique:** You can learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). 

    You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
* **Thrown Weapon Fighting:** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
* **Two Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Basic Lashing
Upon speaking the first ideal at 3rd level, your path along within Windrunner Order begins as a squire and you gain the ability to fly.  At any time, you can expend two stormlight charges (no action required) to gain a 30 ft. fly (hover) speed until the start of your next turn.

Your fly speed increases to 40 ft. fly (hover), 50 ft. fly (hover), and 60 ft. fly (hover) at 7th, 13th, and 17th level respectively.

### Light as a Feather
At 3rd level, you can cast feather fall by expending one stormlight charge.

### Stormlight Tempo
Also at 3rd level, stormlight is beginning to flow through your body freely, its power enhancing every action you make.  When you take the attack action or use stormlight during your turn, you can, as a bonus action, expend stormlight to make a number of attacks equal to the number of charges you expend.  You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier per short rest.  At 3rd level you can expend only one stormlight charge per bonus action.  This limit increases to two at 11th level and to three at 20th level.

### Combat Prowess
At 6th level, the bond with your spren and your dedication to the Order of Windrunners grows, and the second ideal's words come to you

>*I will protect those who cannot protect themselves*

Upon speaking the words, you gain a weath of abilities that allow you to excel in and out combat.

* **Extra Attack:** You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 
* **Shardblade Shield:** When you are hit by an attack and you are wielding your Shardblade, you can use your reaction to expend two stormlight charges to transform your shardblade into a shield, momentarily adding your proficiency bonus to your AC against the triggering attack.  After the attack your Shardblade reverts back into whatever weapon it was before the attack.  You can use this reaction even if you are already wielding a shield.
* **Empowered Flight:** As an action, you can expend 8 stormlight charges to cast Fly on yourself at 3rd level without any components.  You must maintain concentration on the spell, and make concentration checks as if you cast the spell with a spell slot.

### Gravitational Adhesion
At 9th level you have progressed and are now a fully fledged member of the Windrunners and can now begin taking on squires.  The following words come to you:

>*I will protect even those that I hate, so long as it is right*[^windrunner2]
<!-- <sup><a id="windrunner1b" href="#windrunner1">[1]</a></sup> -->

As the bond to your spren grows even stronger, your ability to bind things together using stormlight grows as well and you gain the following abilities:
* **Full Lashing:** You can expend one stormlight charge to cast the spell Immovable Object at 2nd level, without using any material components, or to cast Magnify Gravity at 1st level.  You can expend up to three additional charges to increase either spell's level by one for each additional charge.  You can also quicken the casting time to a bonus action by spending an additional stormlight charge.  You use your [Windrunner DC](#windrunner-dc) as your spell save DC for these spells.
* **Reverse Lashing:** When a creature within 20 feet of you including you is targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to expend two stormlight charges to draw all nearby ranged attacks towards you.  Until the beginning of your next turn, all ranged attacks targeting any creature within 20 feet of you targets you instead of the original target.  All ranged attacks originally targeting a creature other than you require a new attack roll against you.  All attacks that originally target you are made normally and do not require a new attack roll.  If you are wielding a shield when you make this reaction, add a bonus to your AC equal to your Dexterity modifier against all ranged attacks made against you until the beginning of your next turn.

### Resonance
At 13th level you become a master within the Order of Windrunners.  The fourth ideal comes to you:

> *I accept that there will be those I cannot protect*

In speaking the fourth ideal, your stormlight seems to resonante outwards from you giving you the ability to empower other nearby individuals with basic windrunner abilities.  You gain the ability to expend 15 stormlight charges to cast Wind Walk.[^windrunner3]
<!-- <sup><a id="windrunner2b" href="#windrunner2">[^windrunner2]</a></sup> -->

You and your allies cannot regain stormlight while you Wind Walk in this way.

Additionally, you gain the ability to enter the **infused** [Lifestance](#lifestance) vorin stance.

### Herald of the Highstorm
At 18th level, you discover the final ideal of the Windrunners making you the Herald of the Windrunners:

>*I will protect all this world*[^windrunner4]
<!-- <sup><a id="windrunner3b" href="#windrunner3">[3]</a></sup> -->

As an action, you can transform yourself into the Herald of the Windrunners as a highstorm appears at a point you choose within 150ft.  The highstorm is a cylinder with a radius of 60 ft. and a height of 150 ft.  For the next minute you gain the following benefits while the highstorm rages:
* You gain a 90 ft. flying (hover speed)
* Any creatures you choose within the storm gain a 30ft flying (hover) speed.
* Any creature you choose within the storm who starts or enters the strom for the first time on their turn must make a Strength saving throw against your [Windrunner DC](#windrunner-dc).  On a failed save the creature takes 2d6 magical bludgeoning damage and 2d6 thunder as the highstorm ravages them with an unstoppable wave of power.
* Ranged weapon attacks in the storm's area are impossible.
* As a bonus action you can expend 5 stormlight charges to cast Pulse Wave using your [Windrunner DC](#windrunner-dc) as your spell save DC.
* You regain 3 stormlight charges per round.
* At the start of your turn, you can move the highstorm up to 30 ft.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Skybreaker Order
Truth and devotion towards upholding their code are the central tennets of the Skybreaker order.  Good or evil does not weigh into their decisions; that is left for others to decide.  Their goal is to follow a code of someone or something that is just, and to enforce those laws, fanatically if need be.  For the sky would break before one would go back on their word.

### Spren
As a skybreaker, the powers that grant you the power of justice are dervied from Highspren.  Many other spren dislike them for their inflexibility in life, as such, they are known as isolationists, appearing as black slits in the air, which can pull open to reveal stars shining within.

### Hit Points
*1st-level Skybreaker feature*

* **Hit Die:** 1d10 per skybreaker level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per herald level after 1st

### Proficiencies:
*1st-level Skybreaker feature*

* **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, shields
* **Weapons:** Simple and martial melee weapons, [skylance](#skylance)

* (a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon
* (a) a priest's Pack or (b) an explorer's Pack
* Chain mail and a holy symbol

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.

### Skybreaker DC
*1st-level Skybreaker feature*

Some Skybreaker abilities and spells will require your Skybreaker DC which is calculated as 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

### Weapon Mastery
*1st-level Skybreaker feature*  

Your training as a skybreaker allows you to use the Mastery property of two kinds of weapons which you are proficient with.  Whenever you level up, you can change the weapons that you have mastery with.  You gain an additional weapon mastery at 4th and 10th level.

### Skybreaker Fighting Style:
*1st-level Skybreaker feature*

As skybreaker are naturally protectors, you automatically gain the *Gravitational Repositioning* fighting style.  

**Gravitational Repositioning:** When you hit a creature with a melee attack you can choose to move up to your movement to another location around the targeted creature that is less than or equal to the distance you are from the targeted creature when you make the attack roll.  When you make this movement, you cannot be targeted by any opportunity attacks.  When you make this movement, you float gently into the air by the power of your basic lashing as you float to reposition to a more tactially advantageous location.

Additionally, at 1st level, you adopt a style of fighting as your speciality.  Choose one of the following options.  You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Blind Fighting:** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you. 
* **Defense:** You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
* **Improved Interception:** When you use your *Dexterous Protector* fighting style feature but the creature you protect is still hit by the attack, you can reduce the damage the creature takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this feature.
* **Skylancer:** On your turn, if you are under the effects of your [Basic Lashing](#basic-lashing) and you make an attack with a skylance, you can regain 1 stormlight charge.  Additionally on your turn, you can disengage from the creature you target with your skylance (no action required).  Finally, if you use [Stormlight Tempo](#stormlight-tempo) before making an attack with a skylance, each charge you expend adds an additional damage dice to your skylance attack instead of allowing extra attacks.<sup><a id="windrunner4b" href="#windrunner4">[4]</a></sup>
* **Superior Technique:** You can learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). 

    You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
* **Thrown Weapon Fighting:** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
* **Two Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
* **Unarmed Fighting:** Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you. 

### Stormlight Smite
At 3rd level you begin on your path towards truth and law within the Skybreaker Order.  As such you have been bequeathed the power to smite creatures using stormlight.

Immediately after hitting a creature with a melee weapon or unarmed strike, you may use your bonus action to infuse your strike with stormlight energy by expending up to your proficiency bonus number of stormlight charges.  Your damage roll gains extra radiant damage of 2d4 for 1 stormlight charge, plus 1d4 for each additional stormlight charge.  This damage die increases as you gain Herald levels to a d6 at level 5, d8 at level 9, d10 at level 13, and d12 at level 17.

Once can use this feature a proficiency number of times.  You regain all uses of this feature once you finish a short or long rest.

#### Conditional Justice
As an executor of law, you have and will continue to gain the capabilities to inflict additional conditions upon your judgements.  When you use your Stormlight Smite feature, you can choose to forgo extra damage dice in order to inflict additional features upon your smite, as described in the table below.  All saving throws are made against your Skybreaker DC.

| Name | Level Required | Dice Forgone | Condition Inflicted |
| ---  |    ---         | ---          |    ---      |
| Interrogating Justice | 3rd | 1 | When you hit your target, metal chains appear at the point of impact and latch onto the creature.  The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by magical chains for 1 minute.  While a creature is restrained by these chains, they cannot speak a deliberate lie.  If the target succeeds on the save, the chains fall off harmlessly and disappear.  A creature restrained by the chains or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your Skybreaker DC.  On a success, the target is freed.
| Frightening Justice | 3rd | 1 | When you hit your target, they must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can retry the saving throw to end the effect. |
| Thunderous Justice | 3rd | 1 | When you hit your target, they must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked prone. |
| Branding Justice | 6th | 1 | When you hit your target the creature loses the invisible condition if it has it as it is shrouded in dim blue light, and they can't become invisible for the next minute. |
| Blinding Justice | 9th | 1 | When you hit your target, they must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can retry the saving throw to end the effect. |
| Staggering Justice | 13th | 2 | When you hit your target, they must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can retry the saving throw to end the effect. |
| Stunning Justice | 18th | 2 | When you hit your target, they must make an Constitution saving throw or be stunned. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can retry the saving throw to end the effect. |

<!-- ### Basic Lashing
Upon speaking the first ideal at 3rd level, your path along within Windrunner Order begins as a squire and you gain the ability to fly.  At any time, you can expend two stormlight charges (no action required) to gain a 30 ft. fly (hover) speed until the start of your next turn.

Your fly speed increases to 40 ft. fly (hover), 50 ft. fly (hover), and 60 ft. fly (hover) at 7th, 13th, and 17th level respectively. -->

<!-- ### Light as a Feather
At 3rd level, you can cast feather fall by expending one stormlight charge. -->

<!-- ### Stormlight Tempo:
Also at 3rd level, stormlight is beginning to flow through your body freely, its power enhancing every action you make.  When you take the attack action or use stormlight during your turn, you can, as a bonus action, expend stormlight to make a number of attacks equal to the number of charges you expend.  You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier per short rest.  At 3rd level you can expend only one stormlight charge per bonus action.  This limit increases to two at 11th level and to three at 20th level. -->

### Ideal of Justice
At 6th level, you speak your first oath to seek and administer justice.  This can include finding a perosn or thing to act as a teacher or guide who can help you craft your first oath.

>*I swear to seek justice, to let it guide me*

Upon taking this oath you gain further abilities that allow you to administer that justice.

* **Extra Attack:** You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the attack action on your turn.
* **Clarity of Intent:** As a skybreaker you cannot allow yourself to be easily swayed by those who wish to decieve you.  You are immune to the charmed condition.
* **Gravitational Law:** Your laws are inescapable, and as such you gain the ability to use the surge of gravitation to pull creatures into your grasp.  Before you take the attack action on your turn, you can expend stormlight to force a creature of your size or smaller that you can see within 30 feet of you, not behind any physical cover, to make a Strength saving throw.  On failure, they are pulled 10 feet for every stormlight charge you expend towareds you stopping within 5 feet of you.  On success there is no effect.

<!-- ### Combat Prowess
At 6th level, the bond with your spren and your dedication to the Order of Windrunners grows, and the second ideal's words come to you

>*I will protect those who cannot protect themselves*

Upon speaking the words, you gain a weath of abilities that allow you to excel in and out combat.

* **Extra Attack:** You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 
* **Shardblade Shield:** When you are hit by an attack and you are wielding your Shardblade, you can use your reaction to expend two stormlight charges to transform your shardblade into a shield, momentarily adding your proficiency bonus to your AC against the triggering attack.  After the attack your Shardblade reverts back into whatever weapon it was before the attack.  You can use this reaction even if you are already wielding a shield.
* **Empowered Flight:** As an action, you can expend 8 stormlight charges to cast Fly on yourself at 3rd level without any components.  You must maintain concentration on the spell, and make concentration checks as if you cast the spell with a spell slot. -->

### Ideal of Dedication
At 9th level you speak your oath to dedicate yourself to a greater truth, typically a code or a person.

>*I swear to follow the laws of Pelor*

you gain the following benefits:
* **Undeterred Conviction:** You are immune to the frightened condition
* **Forceful Presense:** Acting as a bastion of truth and law, you have advantage on all ability checks relating to enforcing your oath
* **Self Lashing:** As you've grown more accustomed to order of gravitation, you've learned how to walk on walls and ceilings.  Once per turn, (no action required) you gain the ability to shift the direction of gravity for yourself.  When you do so, you fall in the direction that you shift gravity towards, you take fall damage as usual, if you fall a great distance towards your new "down".  You must expend 1 stormlight at the end of each of your turns that this feature is active.  When you shift the direction of gravity to follow the natural gravity of whatever location you're currently in, the lashing disappates and you become normally affected by gravity.

    Additionally, while you are falling, you can use your reaction to expend 1 stormlight charge to become resistant to the next source of fall damage until the start of your next turn.

<!-- ### Gravitational Adhesion
At 9th level you have progressed and are now a fully fledged member of the Windrunners and can now begin taking on squires.  The following words come to you:

>*I will protect even those that I hate, so long as it is right*<sup><a id="windrunner1b" href="#windrunner1">[1]</a></sup>

As the bond to your spren grows even stronger, your ability to bind things together using stormlight grows as well and you gain the following abilities:
* **Full Lashing:** You can expend one stormlight charge to cast the spell Immovable Object at 2nd level, without using any material components, or to cast Magnify Gravity at 1st level.  You can expend up to three additional charges to increase either spell's level by one for each additional charge.  You can also quicken the casting time to a bonus action by spending an additional stormlight charge.  You use your [Windrunner DC](#windrunner-dc) as your spell save DC for these spells.
* **Reverse Lashing:** When a creature within 20 feet of you including you is targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to expend two stormlight charges to draw all nearby ranged attacks towards you.  Until the beginning of your next turn, all ranged attacks targeting any creature within 20 feet of you targets you instead of the original target.  All ranged attacks originally targeting a creature other than you require a new attack roll against you.  All attacks that originally target you are made normally and do not require a new attack roll.  If you are wielding a shield when you make this reaction, add a bonus to your AC equal to your Wisdom modifier against all ranged attacks made against you until the beginning of your next turn. -->

### Ideal of Crusade
At 13th level you begin a personal quest that will likely define your contributions in this life:

> *I will cleanse the Shin of their false leaders*[^skybreaker1]
<!-- > <sup><a id="skybreaker1b" href="#skybreaker1">[1]</a></sup> -->

In your quest you are bequeathed with the following boon(s):
[[TODO]]

### Ideal of Law
At 18th level, you become the embodiment of law and truth.  You know your truths held by you and thus shed the crutches of your earlier ideals:

>*I will be true*

As the emobiment of law, you inherintely can discern truth from deceit.  You know if you hear a deliberate lie

As a bonus action you become the Paragon of Justice for 1 minute and gain the following benefits:
* You gain a 30ft. flying (hover) speed
* You regain 5 hit points per turn
* When you hit a creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also force it to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is magically banished to its native plane of existence if it's currently not there. On a successful save, the creature can't be banished by this feature for 24 hours.
* You gain the benefits of the [[Hand Of Judgement]] spell

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Edgedancer Order

Edgedancers channel the surges of Abrasion and Progression.  Abrasion allowing them to move elegantly and manuever around battlefields, rooftops, or farm fields without a single mistep, while Progression grants them the power to grow and heal the world by curing wounds, blooming flowers, and restoring life. They attract the most refined and articulate of people, and yet they rarely pay any attention to politics or high society, instead focusing on and listening the ordinary people of the world.  Whether it be recounting the tales of traditions to the children of a village, or remembering the face of enemy as he takes his final breath under an edgedancer's blade.

### Spren
As an edgedancer, you gain your powers through your bond with Cultivationspren.  They are the purest expression of Cultivation, the god of change and growth.  Cultivationspren typically are seen in the physical realm as a growing vine with crystals.

* **Hit Die:** 1d8 per edgedancer level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 3d4x10 gp.

### Unarmored Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. 

### Edgedancer Fighting Style:
*1st-level Edgedancer feature*

At 1st level, you adopt a style of fighting as your speciality.  Choose one of the following options.  You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Blessed Warrior:** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. They count as edgedancer spells for you and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the cleric spell list. 
* **Blind Fighting:** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you. 
* **Defense:** You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Druidic Warrior:** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. They count as edgedancer spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them.

You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
* **Thrown Weapon Fighting:** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
* **Two Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
* **Unarmed Fighting:** Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

#### Spell Slots

The Edgedancer Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your edgedancer spells of 1st level or higher.  To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.  You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest

You start with two 1st-level spell slots at edgedancer level 3, and gain more as you gain more edgedancer levels.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The edgedancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your edgedancer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of edgedancer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the edgedancer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of edgedancer spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your edgedancer level rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Preparing a new list of edgedancer spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. 

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your edgedancer spells.  You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.  In addition, you can use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a edgedancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use your Shardblade as a spellcasting focus for casting edgedancer spells.

### Remember the Forgotten
You learn the Spare the Dying Cantrip

### Healing Hands Spells
As an edgedancer, healing is your specialty and as such when you reach the respective edgedancer levels you learn the following spells and always have them prepared, and they do not count against the number of spells prepared:

| Level | Spells |
| ----- | --- |
| 3rd   | Spare the Dying, Cure Wounds, Healing Word |
| 5th   | Aid, Healing Spirit |
| 9th   | Life Transference, Mass Healing Word |
| 13th  | Aura of Life | 
| 17th  | Mass Cure Wounds, Greater Restoration | 

### Slickness
As a bonus action you can expend one stormlight charge to become *slick* for 1 minute which gives the following benefits:
* Your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain
* Spells and other magical effects can neither reduce your speed or cause you to become paralyzed or restrained
* You can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints such as manacles or a creature that has you grappled.
* Being underwater imposes no penalites on the your movement or attacks.
* You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
* Your movement speed doubles

Additionally, while you are *slick*, at the beginning of each of your turns you can expend either one stormlight charge or gain one level of exhaustion to become *untouchable* and gain the following effects until the start of your next turn.
* You gain a +2 bonus to your AC
* You gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws
* You gain an additional action on each of your turns.  This action can be used only to Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, Use an Object action, or to cast a spell from the [Healing Hands](#Healing-Hands) spell list
* The Haste spell has no effect on you while you are *untouchable*

### Memoirs of the Forgotten
At 6th level, the bond with your spren and your dedication to the people of the world grows and the second ideal's words come to you.

>*I will remember those who have been forgotten*

Upon speaking the words, you gain the ability to keep a memoir of those who have been forgotten.

As a reaction when a creature dies within 60 ft of you or as an action upon physically inspecting the corpse of a creature, you can take a *memoir* of the creature.  You can only take a *memoir* of a creature once. The *memoir* you take can be something physical or mental.  Possible examples include but are not limited to: trinkets, names in a book, a mental photo library, a flower, or a rock.  You can have up to your proficiency bonus number of *memoirs* at a time.  If you attempt to gain another *memoir* when you are at your max, you must choose to release a *memoir* you already have.  The manifestation (trinket/name/memory) may not disappear, but the magical essence that makes it a *memoir* does.  You can use the *memoirs* in the following ways:

* When you make an ability check relating to the origin of a *memoir* you own (DM's discretion) you can gain advantage on an ability check relating to that check by releasing a *memoir*.
* As a part of a melee or spell attack, you can release one *memoir* to add an additional damage die to the damage roll the attack.
* When you cast a spell that restores hitpoints you can release one *memoir* to either add an additional die of healing to the spell cast, or to reroll any number of dice used for healing once, if you reroll a die you must use the new value rolled.
* While you have at least one *memoir* in your possesion, the thought of their memory empowers you allowing you to attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Attentive Personality
At 9th level you have progressed far within the Order of Edgedancers and the following words come to you:

>*I will listen to those who have been ignored*

You gain the following abilities as you connect and listen to the people of the world

#### Inviting Presence
* Whenever you make a persuasion ability check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. 
* You always have the spell *Charm Person* prepared, at 13th level you also always have *Charm Monster* prepared.
* When you cast a spell that charms a creature, you can expend a number of stormlight charges equal to the spells level to cause the targets of the spell to have disadvantage on the saving throw to resist the charm effects.

#### Everlasting Memory
* You gain the ability to channel your stormlight into expended memoirs to reinvigorate them with life.  As a bonus action you can expend 3 stormlight charges to create a memoir from the memory of a memoir you've released previously.

<!-- Ideas: -->
<!-- * Charm person, but the monster makes the roll straight when fighitng, disadvantage if not fighting. -->
<!-- * You gain proficiency in persuasion, if you already have proficiency in persuasion you gain expertise, if you already have expertise, you gain expertise in another skill you are proficient with. -->
<!-- * As a bonus action, you can give a memoir to another creature and they can expend the memoir they recieve in the usual way syou can use a memoir. -->
<!-- * As a reaction when a willing ally within 30 ft that you can see makes an ability check, attack roll, or casts a spell that restores hit points, you can apply the relevant effect of your Memoir of the Forgotten ability to the triggering effect. -->


### Slip from the Mind
<!-- Maybe expand upon this -->
At 13th level you become a master within the Order of Edgedancers.  The fourth ideal comes to you:

>*I will recognize there are some so evil, forgetting their memory will save others*

* When you are targeted by an attack, you can expend 2 stormlight charges to cause that attack to have disadvantage (no action required)

### Tree of Life

At 18th level you become an embodiment of healing and good will. The fifth and final ideal comes to you:

>*I will never forget what makes this world worth living*

As an action, you can go into your tree of life form.  While in this form you gain the following benefits
* You gain the effects of the foresight spell 
* When you begin your turn you can choose to be *slick* and/or *untouchable* with no stormlight cost
* You gain a healing aura that expands 30 ft out from you and is centered on you
  * All creatures you choose who begin their turn within your aura or when they enter your aura for the first time on their turn, who have at least one hit point can regain 5 hit points.
  * Additionally, all unconcious creatures within the aura are automatically stabalized.

## Lightweaver Order
Lightweaver's live their lives on the razor's edge of deception.  Whether that deception is used to create beautiful artwork that transports the viewer to another world, or to build illusions to allow for decpetion, espionage, and subterfuge.  To build these illusions, their oaths revolve around speaking powerful truths about themselves, often deep personal realizations about their own lives that most people would choose to ignore, for understanding truths is what allows them create lies that can masquerade as truths even to the most trained eye.

Lightweavers are most interested in the arts, including all kinds of visual arts and theater.  They range widely in personality from the quiet and introspective painter to the gregarious stage performer, with everything in between.  What unites them tends to be a love of art, the importance of entertainment, beauty, and art in a person's life, and striving to make sure that the world doesn't just live through any danger, because mere survival isn't enough unless there is something to live for.

### Spren
As a lightweaver, you gain your powers through Cryptics.  Cryptics are creatures of logic, and they enjoy learning about truths and the lies that can be weaved between them.  The more powerful the truths the more likely powerful lies are to exist in the cracks.  Cryptics in the material plane appears as constantly shifting patterns of lines, shapes, or other manifestations.  When you try to look at one, it is impossible to fully grasp the entire shape of the pattern as it is constantly shifting and changing, and there are always more deatils to be found in their scintillating shape.

* **Hit Die:** 1d8 per windrunner Level

| 20th | 6 | 16 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |

#### Cantrips

You learn four cantrips: [Illusory Onslaught](#illusory-onslaught), Minor Illusion, and two other cantrips of your choice from the [Lightweaver spell list](#lightweaver-spell-list).  You learn additional lightweaver cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 5th cantrip at 4th level and a 6th at 10th level.

#### Spell Slots

The Lightweaver Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your lightweaver spells of 1st level or higher.  To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.  You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest

You start with two 1st-level spell slots at lightweaver level 1, and gain more as you gain more lightweaver levels.

#### Spells Known

You know three 1st level [lightweaver spells](#lightweaver-spell-list) of your choice.  Additionally you always know the spell *Disguise Self* and it doesn't count against your number of lightweaver spells known.

The Spells Known column of the Lightweaver Spellcasting table shows when you learn more lightweaver spells of 1st level or higher.  Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.   For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Whenever you take a long rest you can replace one of the lightweaver spells you know with another spell of your choice from the lightweaver spell list.  The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your lightweaver spells.  You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.  In addition, you can use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a lightweaver spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use your Shardtool, artisan tool, or musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for casting Lightweaver spells.

### Shardtool
*3rd-level Lightweaver feature which replaces the Shardblade feature*

At 3rd level, your bond to your spren has evolved to the point where you gain the ability to summon them in the material plane. You can use your action to summon your Shardtool in your empty hand.  The Shardtool acts as a spellcasting focus for your spells.  You can choose the form that this tool takes each time you create it. The form of the tool must be a tool with which you are proficient.

Your Shardtool disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the tool (no action required), or if you die.

#### Absorb Magic Tool
You also gain the ability to absorb magic tools which you are proficient with and meld them into your shardtool.  You can absorb a magic tool into your shardtool by performing a special ritual while you hold the tool. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.  You can't affect an artifact or a sentient tool in this way.  Once completed, when you summon your shardtool, you can instead choose to summon the magical tool you absorbed which acts as your shardtool, but doesn't gain the benefits of being Awakened, Ascendant or Exalted.  You can dismiss this tool into an extradimensional space as if it were your shardtool.  You can only absorb one magical tool at a time. The magical tool ceases to be absorbed by your shardtool if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different tool, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The tool appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. 

#### Awakened Shardtool
*7th-level Lightweaver feature which replaces the Awakened Shardblade feature*

At 7th level you become more attuned with your spren and your Shardtool becomes more responsive to your commands. Any tool you create with your Shardtool feature has a +1 bonus to its spell attack rolls and damage dealt by spell attacks.

#### Ascendant Shardtool
*11th-level Lightweaver feature which replaces the Ascendant Shardblade feature*

At 11th level your bond with your spren has grown significantly. Any tool you create with your Shardtool feature has a +2 bonus to its spell attack rolls and damage dealt by spell attacks.

#### Exalted Shardtool
*15th-level Lightweaver feature which replaces the Exalted Shardblade feature*

At 15th level your bond with your spren has grown to new heights. Any tool you create with your Shardtool feature has a +3 bonus to its spell attack rolls and damage dealt by spell attacks.

### Lightweaver Ideals
Lightweaver's are different from every other order in that their ideals are not rigid or standard in any way other than the first ideal which is identical across all orders.  For the second through fifth ideals, lightweavers speak individual truths about themselves which are truths that the lightweaver might not want to recognize or acknowledge, but are necessary in order for them to learn to distinguish between real truths and the lies they can create to cover them up.

When you speak your ideals at 6th, 9th, 13th, and 18th level, it should be a truth about yourself that is difficult to confront but allows you to understand truths and your powers more.

There are a few examples of ideals from the Stormlight Archives in the Footnotes below (SPOILERS BEWARE)[^lightweaver1]

### Stormlight Powered Illusions
*3rd-level Lightweaver feature*

When you cast an *illusion* spell that has a duration that is greater than or equal to 10 minutes, you can choose to expend a number of stormlight charges equal to the spell's level to cast the spell without expending a spell slot.  The spell still requires material components that are consumed upon casting.

### Improved Minor Illusion
*3rd-level Lightweaver feature*

When you cast Minor Illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell. 

### Personal Disguise
*3rd-level Lightweaver feature*

You can cast disguise self using a stormlight charge instead of a spell slot.  Additionally, when you cast disguise self, you can expend one additional stormlight charge to give it a range of touch.  Any creature you touch with this ability must be willing.  

You can only have your proficiency bonus number of Personal Disguise's cast at once (including disguise self cast on yourself).  If you use Personal Disguise when you already have your maximum reached, the oldest casting of disguise self ends immediately.

### Stormlight Empowered Illusions
*6th-level Lightweaver feature*

When you cast a lightweaver illusion spell, you can expend one charge per spell level to extend the duration according to the table below.  Illusion cantrips can be extended at no cost.

| Spell Duration | Extended Duration |
| --- | --- |
| 1 Round | 2 Rounds |
| 1 Minute | 2 Minutes |
| 10 Minutes | 1 Hour | 
| 1 Hour | 2 Hours |
| 8 Hours | 24 Hours |
| 12 Hours | 24 Hours |
| 24 Hours | 7 Days |
| 10 Days | 30 Days |
| Until Dispelled | Until Dispelled |

### Malleable Illusions
*6th-level Lightweaver feature*

Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell's normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion. 

### Body of Lies
*9th-level Lightweaver feature*

When you are hit by an attack roll you can see, you can use your reaction to expend 5 stormlight charges to summon an illusory dupliciate of yourself in your space.  When you do so, the triggering attack automatically misses you and the illusion then disappates.  Additionally, you may teleport up to 10 feet away to an unoccupied space that you can see.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Intimate Riposte
*9th-level Lightweaver feature*

As you become more comfortable with the truth's you've awakend in yourself you've gained the ability to see through lies that others make to conceal the dark intimate truths they dare not even acknowledge, and to use those truths as leverage.  As an action, you magically telepathically communicate with a creature within 30 feet of you.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC.  The target automatically succeeds on the save if it is a construct.  On a successful saving throw this attempted infiltration has no effect.

On a failed saving throw, you pierce the mind of the creature you target and extract a powerful intimate truth the target fears to acknowledge.  You gain no knowledge of this secret as it is a jumbled mess of memories and emotions, but the target is convinced you know it, and that you will share the secret if they cause harm to you.

The first time in the next minute, you are attacked, damaged, or targeted by a harmfull spell or effect cast by the target who's secret you hold, you can riposte by revealing their secret to the world.  Everybody but the target hears nothing, but the target is emotionally and psychologically wrecked by this truth that you reveal, and they take 9d12 psychic damage, and the effect ends.

When the effect ends, the creature realizes that your knowledge of their intimate truth was only an illusion, and they have no understanding of why it held you in such fear.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. 

### Omnipotent Illusions
*13th-level Lightweaver feature*

As an action you can cast Mirage Arcane and Project Image each once per long rest without expending a spell slot.

### Illusory Army
*18th-level Lightweaver feature*

You learn the spell [Army of the Mind](#army-of-the-mind), it is a lightweaver spell and it doesn't count against your number known lightweaver spells.

### Lightweaver Spell List

## Stoneward Order
The Stonewards are seen as the infantry and ground troops of the Knights Radiants alongside Windrunners.  They tended to attract people interested in warfare, but also challenge, prowess with weapons and athleticism.  Throughout the world, they were widely known for being dependable, strong and filled with resolve.

In battle, they served as the frontline troops.  In times of peace, on the other hand, they were often explorers, but also sportsmen, often organizing and engaging in various competitions and events.

### Spren
The spren of the stonewards are Peakspren, they tend to appear as rocks or stone creatures who wear human clothing and tend to be bald with their heads sporting more cracks than the ret of their bodies.

Some Stoneward abilities and spells will require your Stoneward DC which is calculated as 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

### Earthly Essence
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.

Additionally, you learn the Mold Earth cantrip if you don't know it already  

### Stoneward Fighting Style:
*1st-level Stoneward feature*

At 1st level, you adopt a style of fighting as your speciality.  Choose one of the following options.  You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Blind Fighting:** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you. 
* **Defense:** You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Druidic Warrior:** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. They count as stoneward spells for you, and Constitution is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the druid spell list. 
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
* **Improved Interceptor:** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier (to a minimum of 0 damage).

### Vorin Stances
Upon reaching 3rd level as a fledgling stoneward, your path begins with the extensive training in the different methods of mastering your shardblade, also known as vorin stances.  Each stance has it's strengths and weaknesses and it is common for differnet shardbearers to favor one or a few stances, but to be proficient in many, in order to best suit their combat situation.

To begin your training, you learn two vorin stances.  When you swear your greater oaths at higher levels, you will learn additional vorin stances and gain infusions to  upgrade one stance you know (including one you just learned).  How many you have of each is shown in the Vorin Stances and Infusions columns of the Stoneward Table.

You can switch out one stance you know for another one on level up.

### Shardplate
As a Bonus Action on your turn, you can expend any number of stormlight to summon stormlight infused shardplate around your body, granting yourself temporary hit points equal to your constitution modifier + a number of d12's equal to the number of stormlight charges you expended.  These temporary hit points dissappear after 1 hour or when you finish a short rest.
 
### Roots of Stone
When you reach the 3rd level in this class you learn the basics of how to control the earth around you.  You gain the ability to cast the spell Earth Tremor as a Bonus Action by expending 1 stormlight.  You can expend up to your proficiency bonus number of additional charges to increase the spell's level by one for each additional charge. 

You are immune to any difficult terrain created by this spell, and while casting you can expend any number of stormlight charges to allow you to choose that same number of creatures to be immune to the damage and difficult terrain created by this spell.

Over the course of a long rest you can change which stances you infuse.  When a stance is infused, you can used the additional ***Infused*** property that is listed within the stance's description.

### Rockshaper
When you reach 9th level, your bond has grown strong enough that you can begin to shape rock and stone beyond their natural limits and the third ideal comes to you:

And as you speak those words, your attunement with the earth grows further allowing you to cast Move Earth, Stone Shape, or Transmute Rock by expending four, five, or four stormlight charges respectively.

#### Mastery Properties
Each weapon now has a Mastery property, as shown in the weapon tables above. That property is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character. Here are descriptions of each Mastery property. The properties are provided in alphabetical order. If a game feature lets you replace a weapon’s Mastery property with another one, that weapon must meet any prerequisite specified for the new property.

**Cleave**  
*Prerequisite: Melee Weapon, Heavy Property*  
If you hit a creature with a melee attack using this weapon, you can make an attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon’s damage, but don’t add your ability modifier to that damage, unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

**Flamestance**  
*Prerequisite: Wielding the weapon while in Flamestance*  
If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature and you are not disarmed, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can’t be increased in any way, other than increasing the ability modifier.  Additionally, when you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a weapon while in Flamestance, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn.

**Flex**  
*Prerequisite: Versatile Property*  
When you hit with a melee attack using this weapon, you deal its Versatile damage even if you’re wielding it with one hand.

**Graze**

If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can’t be increased in any way, other than increasing the ability modifier.

**Nick**  
*Prerequisite: Light Property*  
When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the Attack action, instead of as a Bonus Action. You can still make this extra attack only once per turn.

**Push**  
*Prerequisite: Heavy, Two-Handed, or Versatile Property*  
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you if it is no more than one size larger than you.

**Topple**  
*Prerequisite: Heavy, Reach, or Versatile Property*  
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. On a failed save, the creature has the Prone condition.

Make an attack roll with your ranged thrown weapon against the two creatures closest to you who intersect the line you've chosen.  
  * A targeted creature gains no benefit of cover originating from physical obstructions.

If the creature has resistance or immunity to the Reactive Damage Type associated with the applied oil you hit the creature with, the creature becomes vulnerable to the Oil's Damage Type for the  the triggering attack.

| Frost Oil | Cold | Fire | Common | 3rd |

| Toxic Oil | Poison | Acid | Uncommon | 3rd |
| Acridic Oil | Acid | Poison | Uncommon | 3rd |
| Rupture Oil | Thunder | Lightning | Rare | 6th |
| Tempest Oil | Lightning | Thunder | Rare | 6th |
| Death Oil | Necrotic | Radiant | Very Rare | 9th |
| Holy Oil | Radiant | Necrotic | Very Rare | 9th |
| Eldritch Oil | Psychic | Force | Legendary | 12th |
| Blast Oil | Force | Psychic | Legendary | 12th |

## New Spells

The spells listed here are primarily for use with the Herald class but may be adapted or used in anyway by other classes, although balance is not guaranteed.

### Illusory Onslaught
*Illusion cantrip*

* **Casting Time:** 1 action
* **Range:** Self (5-foot radius) or, 60 feet
* **Component:** V, S, M(a tool used to create the illusion that frightens the target)
* **Duration:** Instantaneous

You weave from thin air a weapon of horror[^illusory_onslaught1] that strikes fear into the heart of your target.  Make either a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you, or a ranged spell attack within 60 ft. as you assail it with your creation.  On a hit, the target takes 1d10 psychic damage.

The spell creates more than one illusory weapon when you reach higher levels: two weapons at 5th level, three weapons at 11th level, and four weapons at 17th level.  You can direct the weapons at the same or different targets.  Make a separate attack roll for each weapon.

Creatures who have truesight or who can naturally see through illusions are immune to this spell.

### Army of the Mind
*9th-level illusion*

* **Casting Time:** 1 action
* **Range:** 90 ft.
* **Component:** V, S
* **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute.

You reach into the etheral plane and pull from magic in the air to weave an army of illusory warriors at a point you choose within range.

When you cast the spell you may designate any number of creatures within a 30-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on that point to be protected by the illusory army.  When a creature is protected they gain the following benefits:

* 10 temporary hit points
* An illusory bodyguard
  * When a protected creature is targeted by an attack, roll any single die, on an even value, the illusory bodyguard becomes the target of the attack, the duplicate has an AC of 10.  On an odd value you remain the target of the attack.  If an attack hits a bodyguard, the bodyguard is destroyed.

As a bonus action on subsequent turns you can move the spell up to 60 feet to a space you can see and refresh the effects of your spell.  When you refresh the spell, creatures you designate in the spell's current area are protected and gain 10 temporary hit points and an illusory bodyguard if they don't already have one.  Creatures who were previously protected by the spell do not lose their protection when the spell is refreshed even if they are not currently in the spell's area.

A creature attacking a target of this spell is unaffected by the illusory bodyguard if it can perceive illusions as false, as with trusight.

When the spell ends, the illusory army, bodyguards, and temporary hit points are destroyed.




<!-- <p id="windrunner1"></p> -->

[^windrunner1]: [Windrunner 1]: Not that you could use the extra attacks anyways as the skylance forbids making any additional attacks during the same turn it is used.

 <!-- <a href="#windrunner1b">↩︎</a> -->

<!-- <p id="windrunner2"></p> -->

[^windrunner2]: [Windrunner 2]: Alternative wordings include: *"I will protect even those I hate, even if the one I hate most is myself"*, and *"I've got to protect people, you know? Even from myself."*  The words you speak don't need to exactly match the words listed here, the third windrunner ideal focuses on protecting others despite one's caveats.

[^windrunner3]: [Windrunner 3]: If your concentration is broken while casting Wind Walk, the spell fails, but you don't lose any charges, similar in spirit to the rules for Longer Casting Times (Players Handbook page 202)

[^windrunner4]: [Windrunner 4]: At this time, we don't know what the 5th ideal is but I'm just putting final ideal in here so if your character gets to say the 5th ideal there is something here.

[^skybreaker1]: [Skybreaker 1]: Also known as the Ideal of Crusade, it requires that a skybreaker undertake a personal quest and complete it to the satisfaction of their highspren. In this case, Sveth from the Stormlight Archive books takes up his oath to kill the leaders of his old civilization who banished and made him truthless (essentially a slave) for fortelling a true future they didn't wish to know.

[^lightweaver1]: [Lightweaver 1]: Some examples of "truths" from the Stormlight Archives.
    Example 1: Shallan in the corner of her visions began to see creepy shapes appearing in the corners of her vision that continued to follow her.  Eventually she was cornered in her room and the creatures were closing in on her when one of them spoke to her, "What are you" to which she responds "What am I? I'm terrified" which on its surface makes sense because she's scared of the monster's in her vision but also, it relates to her drawing abilities, her naievity towards trying to save her family, and trying to steal from a powerful scholar.  She's been putting on a facade of a scholar, of somebody who her brothers can count on to save their family, as somebody who knows what she's doing, when in reality, she's over her head, on the path to destruction and failure, and ultimately, terrified which is a powerful truth about the fact that she isn't who she wants to be and who she needs to be for her family and for herself.

    Example 2: The second truth Shallan spoke was "I killed my father" which is pretty self explanatory.  When she was younger, she killed her father.  Killing her father meant the end of her family, as her mother didn't work and he did all the deals to keep their estate alive, and to keep the debitor's from swooping in.  Now that she'd killed him, as terrible a man he was, she'd just doomed her family to death by the bad people who'd they'd borrowed money from.  So her saying "I killed my father" not only is literally about the fact that she killed somebody, but also relates to the fact that she is the reason that her family is in ruin, which is something that she hasn't acknowledged or really come to terms with.

[^stoneward1]: [Stoneward 1]: You can use whatever definition of Tremorsense (dnd5e, oneDND, homebrew) that you'd like, but I'd suggest the following:
    **Tremorsense**: A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of moving creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it’s detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.

    Tremorsense can’t detect creatures or objects in the air, and Tremorsense doesn’t count as a form of sight.

    If a creature is hidden when you try to sense them with Tremorsense, a contested stealth check is made between the hidden creature's stealth roll and the perciever's passive perception, if the hiding creature gained a bonus to their stealth roll due to a visual obscuration (such as invisibility or fog cloud), the hidden creature's roll takes a -5 penalty,  If the perciever's passive perception is greater than the stealth roll the hidden creature made to become hidden, then the hidden creature loses the hidden status, and the perciever knows the hider's location.

[^stoneward2]: [Stoneward 2]: Note, while earth gliding you can still cast spells, so if you were to earthglide into a castle basement, you wouldn't be able to get through the wall as it is worked stone.  But you could cast Meld Into Stone, or Stone Shape to get past.

[^illusory_onslaught1]: [Illusory Onslaught 1]: Your illusion could be anything that you could think of.  They could be a pack of blood-thirsty dogs, sharp knives, bolts of fire, a well thought out logical arguement, a voodoo doll you carved and now stab/burn, a blanket you wove that you distract with before you punch them, a fortune telling device that always comes up deadly.  Use your imagination and creation skills as a lightweaver to make your attacks unique.
