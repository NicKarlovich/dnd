# Herald
##### Version: *v0.7.3*, *January 16th, 2025* [See Changelog Here](#changelog) 

## Base Herald Class

To begin upon the path of herald, you must be chosen by a spren.  The spren for each order is different, but they are the beings that grant you your powers.  These powers that your spren bequeath to you, must be unlocked by speaking a series of five Ideals.  These five ideals are often powerful statements of purpose and dedication which align your goals with those of your order.

All orders speak the same first ideal, but the second, third, fourth, and fifth ideals are unique for each order.  Additionally, some orders don't require you to speak exactly the same words for each ideal, as long as the intent behind the words you speak match the goals of the ideal.

Together the heralds act as a coalition of knights, often called the Knights Radiant, who embody different ideals, but ultimately work together to protect the world.

### Basic Features:
Hit Points, Proficiencies, and Equipment are based on your [Radiant Order](#radiant-order).  Additionally, any armor or weapon proficiencies gained through any feature other than your subclass cannot be used in conjunction with your class features.  If you use a weapon or armor proficiency from a source that isn't your subclass, you cannot gain the benefits of any feature granted by the herald class or your subclass.[^herald1]

### Spren 
Spren are an integral part of being a herald.  They grant you your powers, and are guide you on your oaths.  For more information on Spren regarding roleplaying, creating your connection to your spren, your oaths, how they can be muted, destroyed and reforged, and how that impacts your gameplay, see the [Spren Information](#spren-information) section at the bottom of the document.

### Radiant Order
In becoming a Knight Radiant you must decide your order.  When you decide your order you agree to dedicate yourself completely to your order.  This means if you take levels in herald you are not allowed to deviate from your order and multiclass.  Additionally, if you have levels in another class you cannot take levels in herald until you lose the levels in the other class(es).
Your choice grants you additional capabilities when you choose it at 1st level.  As you progress along your order you will swear five ideals also known as the Immortal Words, at 3rd, 6th, 9th, 13th, and 18th level.  

Each order also has an ability score, tool and spren, each of which are used to enhance, diversify, and showcase the themes and specializations between each order.

### Stormlight
At 1st level, although you have not sworn the first ideal, as a future member of the Knights Radiant you have the innate ability to absorb and retain stormlight in your body.  Stormlight is a powerful fuel source that allows Knights Radiant to perform their legendary feats.  Your access to stormlight is represented by a number of stormlight charges.  Your herald level determines the number of charges you have, as shown in the Stormlight Charges column of the Herald Table. 

When you expend a stormlight charge, it is unavailable until you finish a long rest, at the end of which you gain all of your expended stormlight charges.

#### Stormlight Veins:
As an action, you can conceal and reveal the stormlight that flows through your veins.  When you reveal your Stormlight Veins, you emit a muted blue light from your skin which emanates bright light for 5 feet and dim light for an additional 5 feet.  When it is concealed, no light is visible.

When you reach 7th level, your understanding and comfort with stormlight means you no longer require air to breathe.

When you reach 14th level, stormlight constantly flows through your veins enhancing your every move.  You gain advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.

### Stormlight Restoration:
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to knit wounds and repair damage to yourself using the Stormlight you absorb.  As a bonus action, you can expend any number of stormlight charges to restore a number of hit points to yourself.  You restore 2 hit points per charge that you expend.

When you reach 10th level, you can expend 5 stormlight charges to cure yourself of any poison or disease, or you can expend 8 stormlight to cure yourself of 1 level of exhaustion

### First Ideal:
At 3rd level you begin your path to becoming a fully fledged Knight Radiant and will begin speaking the Immortal Words.  The First Ideal is the same for all orders, but they will vary as you swear the greater ideals at higher levels.  Your order's ideals and abilities are based on your [Radiant Order](#radiant-order).

The following is the first ideal which officially begins you on your path towards becoming a member of the Knights Radiant:

>*Life before death.  Strength before weakness.  Journey before destination.*  

### Manifest Spren
Upon speaking your first ideal, your connection to your spren has strengthened enough that they can be physically manifested in the physical realm.  When you finish a long rest, you can innately cast Find Familiar requiring no material using the statblock of the owl, but it has the physical characteristics of your spren.  See [The Coppermind](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Coppermind:Welcome) for more information on what your spren looks like.

At 7th level, your spren can innately cast Invisibility on themselves.

### Shardblade
At 3rd level, the bond you have with spren has evolved to the point where you gain the ability to summon them in the material plane.  You can use your interact object to summon your Shardblade in your empty hand.  You can choose the form that this weapon takes each time you create it.  The form of the weapon must be a weapon with which you are proficient.  Additionally, this weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.  If your order grants you the power to cast spells, your Shardblade can act as an arcane focus for your Herald spells.

If the weapon is one that requires ammunition, it magically creates ammunition if you don't provide your own.  If you make a thrown weapon attack with a shardblade, the weapon immediately reappears back in one of your empty hands regardless of the outcome of the attack.

Your Shardblade disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more.  It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

#### Absorb Magic Weapon
You also gain the ability to absorb magic weapons which you are proficient with and meld them into your shardblade.  You can absorb a magic weapon into your shardblade by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.  You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way.  Once completed, when you summon your shardblade, you can instead choose to summon the magical weapon you absorbed which acts as your shardblade.  This absorbed weapon gains the benefits of being Awakened/Ascendant/Exalted.  You can dismiss this weapon into an extradimensional space as if it were your shardblade.  You can only absorb one magical weapon at a time. The magical weapon ceases to be absorbed by your shardblade if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. 

#### Awakened Shardblade 
At 7th level you become more attuned with your spren and your Shardblade becomes more responsive to your commands.  Any weapon you summon with your Shardblade feature has a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is an absorbed weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.

#### Ascendant Shardblade
At 11th level your bond with your spren has grown significantly.  Any weapon you summon with your Shardblade feature has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls, unless it is an absorbed weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.

#### Exalted Shardblade
At 15th level your bond with your spren has grown significantly.  Any weapon you summon with your Shardblade feature has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls, unless it is an absorbed weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Font of Stormlight
Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain a number of stormlight charges, up to your maximum, equal to your [Order Ability Score](#radiant-order) + your proficiency bonus when you finish a short rest.

<!-- ## Second Ideal
Your dedication towards your ideal grows stronger within you.  The powers gained from your Second Ideal is based on your [Radiant Order](#radiant-order) -->

<!-- ## Awakened Shardblade
At 7th level you become more attuned with your spren and your Shardblade becomes more responsive to your commands.  Any weapon you create with your Shardblade feature has a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls. -->

<!-- ## Third Ideal
When you reach 9th level, the words come to you, possibly in a moment of desperation or introspection.  Regardless of how it occurs your adherence to your order grants you additional powers according to your [Radiant Order](#radiant-order) -->

<!-- ## Superior Shardblade
At 11th level your bond with your spren has grown significantly.  Any weapon you create with your Shardblade feature has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. -->

<!-- ## Fourth Ideal
When you reach 13th level, you achieve a level of dedication to your order that few ever reach, you become a source of inspiration for others in your order.  For your great achievement you gain additional powers according to your [Radiant Order](#radiant-order) -->

### Expertise
At 6th level, choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen proficiency.  Additionally you gain expertise in your [Radiant Order's](#radiant-order) Tool.

<!-- ## Exalted Shardblade
At 15th level your bond with your spren has grown significantly.  Any weapon you create with your Shardblade feature has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. -->

### Unbreakable Bond
At 13th level, your bond with your spren is unrivaled amongst those in your order.  Few ever reach this level of connection with their spren, and as such you are immune to being separated.  Any features granted to you by the herald class and your order subclass are not effected by anti-magic fields or other stormlight suppression devices.  Magic weapons or tools that you have absorbed into your shardblade are also not affected by anti-magic fields or suppression devices, but magic armor, rings, or other non-stormlight based magic items are still affected as per usual.

#### Bond Beyond Death
When you reach 17th level, the connection you have with your spren transcends the material plane, allowing you to tether your life essence to the mortal realm when typically it would fade.  When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can choose to instead go to 1 hit point.  Additionally you can expend any number of remaining stormlight charges you have, gaining 2 temporary hit points per charge.  After 1 minute, the temporary hit points are removed.

Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

<!-- ## Fifth Ideal
When you reach 18th level, you become the Herald of your order.  You are the epitome of your Ideal and to unlock the fifth ideal is something truly legendary.  When you swear your fifth and final ideal and become the herald of your order you gain a powerful boon according to your [Radiant Order](#radiant-order) -->

### Stormlight Soul
When you reach 20th level, your connection to the material plane is unmatched you have unlocked total mastery over stormlight.  So much so that it is naturally drawn to you.  Once per long rest, you can as a bonus action regain 20 expended stormlight charges as you pull stormlight from your soul itself to empower your abilities.

Additionally, while your heart and brain are connected, you can regrow any amputated limbs at a rate of 2lb of flesh per minute.

## Windrunner Order
The windrunner order primarily represents protecting anyone and everyone that they can.  Their ability to fly with ease allows them to work as scouts and to easily escort other heralds across the world very quickly.  Their skills tend to include using their gravitational lashings and adhesion abilities to effortlessly fly through the air, and manipulate projectiles and weapons.

### Spren
As a windrunner, the spren you bond with is an Honorspren.  They are the children of Honor, an ancient being which embodied oaths, agreements and binding truths to those who swear them.  Spren typically appear as ribbons of glowing white-blue light.  They generally prefer a humanoid form, although typically only about a handspan tall, but they can grow to be as a large as a regular person.

### Hit Points
###### 1st-level Windrunner feature

* **Hit Die:** 1d10 per windrunner level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per herald level after 1st

* (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) explorer's pack 

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 5d4 x 10 gp.

### Windrunner DC
###### 1st-level Windrunner feature

Some Windrunner abilities and spells will require your Windrunner DC which is calculated as 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.

### Windrunner Weapon Mastery
###### 1st-level Windrunner feature  

Your training as a windrunner allows you to use the Mastery property of two kinds of weapons which you are proficient with.  Whenever you level up, you can change the weapons that you have mastery with.  You gain an additional weapon mastery at 4th and 10th level.

### Windrunner Fighting Style
###### 1st-level Windrunner feature

As windrunners are naturally protectors, you automatically gain the *Dexterous Protector* fighting style.  

**Dexterous Protector:** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.  Additionally, you can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attacks and damage rolls of weapons that you are proficient with through the Windrunner subclass.  The range at which you can protect creatures increases by 5 feet at 6th, 9th, 13th, and 18th level.

Additionally, at 1st level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.  Choose one of the following options.  You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Defense:** You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Improved Interception:** When you use your *Dexterous Protector* fighting style feature but the creature you protect is still hit by the attack, you can reduce the damage the creature takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield, a simple, or martial weapon to use this feature.
* **Skylancer:** On your turn, if you are under the effects of your [Basic Lashing](#basic-lashing) and you make an attack with a skylance, you can regain 1 stormlight charge.  Additionally on your turn, you can disengage from the creature you target with your skylance (no action required).  Finally, if you use [Stormlight Tempo](#stormlight-tempo) before making an attack with a skylance, each charge you expend adds an additional damage dice to your skylance attack instead of allowing extra attacks.[^windrunner1]
<!-- * <sup><a id="windrunner4b" href="#windrunner4">[4]</a></sup> -->
* **Superior Technique:** You can learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). 

    You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
* **Thrown Weapon Fighting:** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
* **Two Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Basic Lashing
###### 3rd-level Windrunner feature
Upon speaking the first ideal, your path along within Windrunner Order begins as a squire and you gain the ability to fly.  At any time, you can expend two stormlight charges (no action required) to gain a 30 ft. fly (hover) speed until the start of your next turn.

Your fly speed increases to 40 ft. fly (hover), 50 ft. fly (hover), and 60 ft. fly (hover) at 7th, 13th, and 17th level respectively.

### Light as a Feather
###### 3rd-level Windrunner feature
You can cast feather fall by expending one stormlight charge.

### Stormlight Tempo
###### 3rd-level Windrunner feature
Also at 3rd level, stormlight is beginning to flow through your body freely, its power enhancing every action you make.  When you take the attack action or use stormlight during your turn, you can, as a bonus action, expend stormlight to make a number of attacks equal to the number of charges you expend.  You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier per short rest.  At 3rd level you can expend only one stormlight charge per bonus action.  This limit increases to two at 11th level and to three at 20th level.

### Combat Prowess
###### 6th-level Windrunner feature
The bond with your spren and your dedication to the Order of Windrunners grows, and the second ideal's words come to you

>*I will protect those who cannot protect themselves*

Upon speaking the words, you gain a wealth of abilities that allow you to excel in and out combat.

* **Extra Attack:** You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 
* **Shardblade Shield:** When you are hit by an attack and you are wielding your Shardblade, you can use your reaction to expend two stormlight charges to transform your shardblade into a shield, momentarily adding your proficiency bonus to your AC against the triggering attack.  After the attack your Shardblade reverts back into whatever weapon it was before the attack.  You can use this reaction even if you are already wielding a shield.
* **Empowered Flight:** As an action, you can expend 8 stormlight charges to cast Fly on yourself at 3rd level without any components.  You must maintain concentration on the spell, and make concentration checks as if you cast the spell with a spell slot.

### Gravitational Adhesion
###### 9th-level Windrunner feature
You have progressed and are now a fully fledged member of the Windrunners and can now begin taking on squires.  The following words come to you:

>*I will protect even those that I hate, so long as it is right*[^windrunner2]
<!-- <sup><a id="windrunner1b" href="#windrunner1">[1]</a></sup> -->

As the bond to your spren grows even stronger, your ability to bind things together using stormlight grows as well and you gain the following abilities:
* **Full Lashing:** You can expend one stormlight charge to cast the spell Immovable Object at 2nd level, without using any material components, or to cast Magnify Gravity at 1st level.  You can expend up to three additional charges to increase either spell's level by one for each additional charge.  You can also quicken the casting time to a bonus action by spending an additional stormlight charge.  You use your [Windrunner DC](#windrunner-dc) as your spell save DC for these spells.
* **Reverse Lashing:** When a creature within 20 feet of you including you is targeted by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to expend two stormlight charges to draw all nearby ranged attacks towards you.  Until the beginning of your next turn, all ranged attacks targeting any creature within 20 feet of you targets you instead of the original target.  All ranged attacks originally targeting a creature other than you require a new attack roll against you.  All attacks that originally target you are made normally and do not require a new attack roll.  If you are wielding a shield when you make this reaction, add a bonus to your AC equal to your Dexterity modifier against all ranged attacks made against you until the beginning of your next turn.
* **Resonance:** [DM Approval Required for use at 9th level, this feature may not fit all campaigns] Your stormlight seems to resonate outwards from you giving you the ability to empower other nearby individuals with basic windrunner flight.  You gain the ability to expend 10 stormlight charges to cast Wind Walk.[^windrunner3]

    You and your allies cannot regain stormlight while you Wind Walk in this way.
* **Child of the Storms:** As a windrunner you've grown become more attuned to the storms that grant you flight and power. As such, you gain the ability to cast Jallarzi's Storm of Radiance by expending 10 stormlight charges.

### Resonant Shardplate
###### 13th-level Windrunner feature
You become a master within the Order of Windrunners.  The fourth ideal comes to you:

> *I accept that there will be those I cannot protect*

You gain a wealth of features upon reaching the fourth ideal.  
* If you didn't gain the ***Resonance*** feature at 9th level you gain it now.  
* Your mastery over the gravitation surge has allowed you to manipulate the gravity of larger areas.  You can expend 10 stormlight to cast Reverse Gravity.
* You also gain your shardplate, a translucent blue glowing set of plate armour that protects you and your allies from attacks.  Your Shardplate grants you an AC bonus equal to half your proficiency bonus rounded down
  * In addition, as a reaction when an ally within 60 feet of you is targeted by an attack, you can transfer your shardplate to that ally.  You lose your bonus to your AC granted by your *Shardplate* and your ally gains that same AC bonus until the start of your next turn. 

Finally, your existing windrunner skills also see some valuable improvements:
* When you use your [Dexterous Protector](#windrunner-fighting-style) fighting style to protect another creature while you have no reactions left, you can expend one stormlight to gain a reaction in order to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.  Once you regain a reaction in this way, you cannot do so again until the start of your next turn. 
* Additionally, if the creature you protect with your Dexterous Protector fighting style is still hit by the attack, you can expend one stormlight to reduce the incoming attack's damage by 1d6.
* Your **Empowered Flight** feature can be used on any willing creature you can touch.
* You learn how to enter the **infused** vorin stance: [Lifestance](#lifestance).

### Herald of the Highstorm
###### 18th-level Windrunner feature
You discover the final ideal of the Windrunners making you the Herald of the Windrunners:

>*I will protect all this world*[^windrunner4]
<!-- <sup><a id="windrunner3b" href="#windrunner3">[3]</a></sup> -->

As an action, you can transform yourself into the Herald of the Windrunners as a highstorm appears at a point you choose within 150ft.  The highstorm is a cylinder with a radius of 60 ft. and a height of 150 ft.  For the next minute you gain the following benefits while the highstorm rages:
* You gain a 90 ft. flying (hover speed)
* Any creatures you choose within the storm gain a 30ft flying (hover) speed.
* Any creature you choose within the storm who starts or enters the storm for the first time on their turn must make a Strength saving throw against your [Windrunner DC](#windrunner-dc).  On a failed save the creature takes 2d6 magical bludgeoning damage and 2d6 thunder as the highstorm ravages them with an unstoppable wave of power.
* Ranged weapon attacks in the storm's area are impossible.
* As a bonus action you can expend 5 stormlight charges to cast Pulse Wave using your [Windrunner DC](#windrunner-dc) as your spell save DC.
* You regain 3 stormlight charges per round.
* At the start of your turn, you can move the highstorm up to 30 ft.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Skybreaker Order
Truth and devotion towards upholding their code are the central tenets of the Skybreaker order.  Good or evil does not weigh into their decisions; that is left for others to decide.  Their goal is to follow a code of someone or something that is just, and to enforce those laws, fanatically if need be.  For the sky would break before one would go back on their word.

### Spren
As a skybreaker, the powers that grant you the power of justice are derived from Highspren.  Many other spren dislike them for their inflexibility in life, as such, they are known as isolationists, appearing as black slits in the air, which can pull open to reveal stars shining within.

### Skybreaker DC
###### 1st-level Skybreaker feature

Some Skybreaker abilities and spells will require your Skybreaker DC which is calculated as 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

### Skybreaker Weapon Mastery
###### 1st-level Skybreaker feature  

Your training as a skybreaker allows you to use the Mastery property of two kinds of weapons which you are proficient with.  Whenever you level up, you can change the weapons that you have mastery with.  You gain an additional weapon mastery at 4th and 10th level.

### Skybreaker Fighting Style
###### 1st-level Skybreaker feature

As skybreaker are naturally protectors, you automatically gain the *Gravitational Repositioning* fighting style.  

**Gravitational Repositioning:** When you hit a creature with a melee attack you can choose to move up to your movement to another location around the targeted creature that is less than or equal to the distance you are from the targeted creature when you make the attack roll.  When you make this movement, you cannot be targeted by any opportunity attacks.  When you make this movement, you float gently into the air by the power of your basic lashing as you float to reposition to a more tactically advantageous location.

Additionally, at 1st level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.  Choose one of the following options.  You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Blind Fighting:** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you. 
* **Defense:** You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
* **Improved Interceptor:** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield, a simple, or martial weapon to use this reaction.
* **Protection:** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
* **Superior Technique:** You can learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). 

    You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
* **Thrown Weapon Fighting:** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
* **Two Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
* **Unarmed Fighting:** Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you. 

### Stormlight Smite
###### 3rd-level Skybreaker feature
You begin on your path towards truth and law within the Skybreaker Order.  As such you have been bequeathed the power to smite creatures using stormlight.

Immediately after hitting a creature with a melee weapon or unarmed strike, you may use your bonus action to infuse your strike with stormlight energy by expending up to your proficiency bonus number of stormlight charges.  Your damage roll gains extra radiant damage of 2d4 for 1 stormlight charge, plus 1d4 for each additional stormlight charge.  This damage die increases as you gain Herald levels to a d6 at level 5, d8 at level 9, d10 at level 13, and d12 at level 17.

Once can use this feature a proficiency number of times.  You regain all uses of this feature once you finish a short or long rest.

#### Conditional Justice
As an executor of law, you have and will continue to gain the capabilities to inflict additional conditions upon your judgment.  When you use your Stormlight Smite feature, you can choose to forgo extra damage dice in order to inflict additional features upon your smite, as described in the table below.  All rolls made to end the condition are made against your Skybreaker DC.

<!-- | Name | Level Required | Dice Forgone | Condition Inflicted |
| ---  |    ---         | ---          |    ---      |
| Interrogating Justice | 3rd | 1 | When you hit your target, metal chains appear at the point of impact and latch onto the creature.  The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by magical chains for 1 minute.  While a creature is restrained by these chains, they cannot speak a deliberate lie.  If the target succeeds on the save, the chains fall off harmlessly and disappear.  A creature restrained by the chains or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your Skybreaker DC.  On a success, the target is freed.
| Frightening Justice | 3rd | 1 | When you hit your target, they must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can retry the saving throw to end the effect. |
| Thunderous Justice | 3rd | 1 | When you hit your target, they must make a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked prone. |
| Branding Justice | 6th | 1 | When you hit your target the creature loses the invisible condition if it has it as it is shrouded in dim blue light, and they can't become invisible for the next minute. |
| Blinding Justice | 9th | 1 | When you hit your target, they must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can retry the saving throw to end the effect. |
| Staggering Justice | 13th | 2 | When you hit your target, they must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can retry the saving throw to end the effect. |
| Stunning Justice | 18th | 2 | When you hit your target, they must make an Constitution saving throw or be stunned. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can retry the saving throw to end the effect. | -->

| Name | Level Required | Dice Forgone | Saving Throw | Condition Inflicted on Fail | End Condition
| ---  |    ---         | ---          |    ---      | --- |  --- |
| Interrogating Justice | 3rd | 1 | Strength, advantage for Large or larger creatures | Restrained by stormlight chains which render the creature unable to speak a deliberate lie | Action for creature within 5 feet (including restrained creature) to make Athletics (Strength)
| Frightening Justice | 3rd | 1 | Wisdom | Frightened | End of affected creature's turn, can repeat save |
| Thunderous Justice | 3rd | 1 | Strength | Pushed 10 feet away and knocked prone | N/A

| Stunning Justice | 18th | 2 | Constitution | Stunned | End of affected creature's turn, can repeat save |

### Ideal of Justice
###### 6th-level Skybreaker feature
As your second ideal, you speak your first oath to seek and administer justice.  This can include finding a person or thing to act as a teacher or guide who can help you craft your first oath.

>*I swear to seek justice, to let it guide me*

Upon taking this oath you gain further abilities that allow you to administer that justice.

* **Extra Attack:** You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the attack action on your turn.
* **Clarity of Intent:** As a skybreaker you cannot allow yourself to be easily swayed by those who wish to deceive you.  You are immune to the charmed condition.
* **Gravitational Law:** Your laws are inescapable, and as such you gain the ability to use the surge of gravitation to pull creatures into your grasp.  Before you take the attack action on your turn, you can expend stormlight to force a creature of your size or smaller that you can see within 30 feet of you who is also not behind any physical cover, to make a Strength saving throw.  On failure, they are pulled 10 feet for every stormlight charge you expend towards you stopping within 5 feet of you.  On success there is no effect.  When you reach the 4th ideal at level 13, the range you can pull creatures from increases to 60 feet.

### Ideal of Dedication
###### 9th-level Skybreaker feature
For your 3rd ideal, you speak your oath to dedicate yourself to a greater truth, typically a code or a person.

>*I swear to follow the laws of Pelor*

you gain the following benefits:
* **Undeterred Conviction:** You are immune to the frightened condition
* **Forceful Presence:** Acting as a bastion of truth and law, you have advantage on all ability checks relating to enforcing your oath
* **Self Lashing:** As you've grown more accustomed to order of gravitation, you've learned how to walk on walls and ceilings.  Once per turn, (no action required) you gain the ability to shift the direction of gravity for yourself.  When you do so, you fall in the direction that you shift gravity towards, you take fall damage as usual, if you fall a great distance towards your new "down".  You must expend 1 stormlight at the end of each of your turns that this feature is active.  When you shift the direction of gravity to follow the natural gravity of whatever location you're currently in, the lashing dissipates and you become normally affected by gravity.

    Additionally, while you are falling, you can use your reaction to expend 1 stormlight charge to become resistant to the next source of fall damage until the start of your next turn.

### Ideal of Crusade
###### 13th-level Skybreaker feature
At 13th level you begin a personal quest that will likely define your contributions in this life:

> *I will cleanse the Shin of their false leaders*[^skybreaker1]

In your quest you are bequeathed with the following boon(s):
[[TODO]]

### Ideal of Law
###### 18th-level Skybreaker feature
You become the embodiment of law and truth.  You know your truths held by you to be true, and thus shed the crutches of your earlier ideals:

>*I am the law*

As the embodiment of law, you inherently can discern truth from deceit.  You know if you hear a deliberate lie

As a bonus action you become the Paragon of Justice for 1 minute and gain the following benefits:
* You gain a 30ft. flying (hover) speed
* You regain 5 hit points per turn
* When you hit a creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also force it to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is magically banished to its native plane of existence if it's currently not there. On a successful save, the creature can't be banished by this feature for 24 hours.
* You gain the benefits of the [Hand Of Judgment](#hand-of-judgment) spell

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Dustbringer Order
The Dustbringers are a misunderstood order amongst most.  They are seen as bringers of destruction and ruin, which is why some seek to be called Releasers instead.  Regardless, dustbringers recognize the danger of entropy that exists in everyday life and seek to build a strong sense of self mastery in order to control it rather than be moved by the forces of the world.  They tend to attract tinkerer's, those who wish to understand how things work whether it be the internals of a gadget or the psyche of a person, so that they can better understand them, and control them.

### Spren
Ashspren are the spren that Dustbringers bond and gain their power from.  They appear as cracks on surfaces or even through the air, although when they move they seem to burn the paths they travel like the singed spines of a leaf.  They are often distrustful of most humans as they have been betrayed many times before during their history.

### Hit Points
###### 1st-level Dustbringer feature

* **Hit Die:** 1d8 per dustbringer level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per herald level after 1st

### Proficiencies
###### 1st-level Dustbringer feature

* **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields
* **Weapons:** Simple melee weapons, martial melee weapons, firearms
* **Tools:** Tinker's Tools
* **Saving Throws:** Constitution, Intelligence
* **Skills:** Choose three skills from Arcana, Athletics, Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Persuasion, Slight of Hand

### Equipment
* (a) chain mail or (b) leather armor
* (a) a longsword or (b) any martial weapon
* (a) a burglar's pack or (b) a scholar's pack
* a dagger and tinker's tools

### Dustbringer Weapon Mastery
###### 1st-level Dustbringer feature
Your lifestyle of training and practice with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of three kinds of Simple or Martial melee weapons of your choice.  Whenever you long rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one weapon of your choice out for another.    

When you reach certain dustbringer levels, you gain the ability to use the Mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the dustbringer table.

### Dustbringer Fighting Style
###### 1st-level Dustbringer feature

At 1st level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.  Choose one of the following options.  You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Blind Fighting:** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you. 
* **Defense:** You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
* **Improved Interceptor:** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield, a simple, or martial weapon to use this reaction.
* **Protection:** When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
* **Superior Technique:** You can learn one maneuver of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). 

  You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
* **Thrown Weapon Fighting:** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
* **Two Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Basic Surge of Division
As a dustbringer, you learn the [Division](#division) cantrip along with Control Flames and Produce Flame.

### Dustbringer Spellcasting
###### 3rd-level Dustbringer feature

#### Spell Slots

The Dustbringer Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your dustbringer spells of 1st level or higher.  To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.  You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest

You start with two 1st-level spell slots at dustbringer level 3, and gain more as you gain more dustbringer levels.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The dustbringer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your dustbringer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of dustbringer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the dustbringer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of dustbringer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your dustbringer level rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Preparing a new list of dustbringer spells requires time spent in meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. 

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your dustbringer spells.  You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.  In addition, you can use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a dustbringer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use your Shardblade as a spellcasting focus for casting dustbringer spells.

### Fabrials
###### 3rd-level Dustbringer feature
Dustbringers are known for their ability to take take things apart to better understand them and control those things.  As a fledgling dustbringer you gain the ability to create fabrials.  Fabrials are weapons and other items which have been augmented by an *Asheon*[^dustbringer1], which grants boons when they are infused with stormlight. *Asheon's* are typically made of wire and gemstones which can be placed around and on weapons in order to grant that weapon extra features.  A weapon or item can only have one *Asheon* attached to it at any time.  Equipping or unequipping a *Asheon* from an object takes 1 minute.  

#### Asheons Known
When you gain this feature, pick three dustbringer *Asheons* to learn.  You learn additional *Asheons* of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Asheons Known column of the Dustbringer Table.  Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the dustbringer Asheons you learned with a new one.

#### Creating Asheons
An Asheon can be created by spending 1 hour tinkering and working carefully to create a temporary housing for stormlight.  They require only basic materials such as wire and a few small gemstones which should not be hard to find.  There is no limit to the number of Asheons a dustbringer can create, but remember, only the dustbringer who created an Asheon can infuse it.

#### Infusing Asheons
Asheons only work if they are given stormlight as a power source.  When a dustbringer finishes a short or long rest, they can choose to expend two stormlight to give an Asheon they can touch, a 1st level infusion.  They can do this to any number of Asheons that they have created within a rest.  An Asheon infused with stormlight stays infused until the infusion is lost as the gemstones fracture (see rules for Fracturing below), or until the dustbringer who infused the Asheon finishes a short or long rest.

~~If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement.~~

#### Infused Features
While an asheon is infused and attached to an appropriate object (which creates a fabrial), the wielder of the fabrial gains the infused property of the Asheon while they are wielding it.  Additionally, they can use the *Signature Feature* of their Asheon a number of times listed in the Asheon's description per short rest while the asheon is infused.

#### Fracturing
When you start your turn with an equipped fabrial, equip a fabrial during combat, or meaningfully use your fabrial outside of combat[^dustbringer2], you need to roll a fracture check against the fracture DC of the Asheon used to make that fabrial.  On success the Asheon continues to operate normally, on failure the fabrial breaks and is no longer infused and must be repaired (see Repairing an Asheon below).  The base object of the fabrial still operates normally even if the asheon attached to it is fractured unless noted otherwise.  A fracture check is made by rolling a d20 with no additional modifiers.

#### Repairing an Asheon
Repairing an Asheon can be done over the course of a short rest and involves reforging any pieces that broke and replacing the small (now fractured) gemstones that held stormlight with new unfractured gemstones.  You can repair any number of Asheons that you created over the course of as short rest.

### Quick Division
###### 6th-level Dustbringer feature
With your first order specific oath as a dustbringer, in order to understand how and why things fall apart, you need to master your friction, your vices, the things in this world that could cause you to slip, and lose control.

> *I will seek self-mastery, for if I falter innocents may die*

* **Negligible Air Resistance:** Your attacks now ignore air resistance and as such you can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Additionally, your base movement speed increases by 10 feet.
* **Friction of the Mind:** You've learned how to talk to people to better understand them and as such, you are better at slipping into their conscious without them noticing.  Whenever you make an Insight or Intimidation skill, you can make it as an Intelligence check even if it normally uses a different ability.
* **No Failures Yet:** When you see a creature using a fabrial you created (including yourself) fail a fracture roll, you can expend 2 stormlight to cause them to succeed instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

### Long Division
###### 9th-level Dustbringer feature
You've begun to control the surge of division, and when you can't you've learned how to use abrasion to redirect the danger and make the eventual destruction go more smoothly.  As such you've gained the following features upon speaking your third oath.

> *I will not let my destructions cause harm to others*

* **Improved Fabrials:** Your Asheons become more stable and efficient allowing for them to house more stormlight and create more powerful effects.  When you infuse an Asheon, you can choose to expend 3 stormlight instead of 2 to give your Asheon a 2nd level infusion.
* **Predicted Destruction:** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to expend 2 stormlight to halve the attack's damage against you.
<!-- If DPS feels low, add the below feature -->
<!-- * **Searing Friction:** Once pur turn, when you hit with a weapon attack, you can add an extra 1d12 fire damage as your weapon creates intense heat from friction igniting your target. -->

### Scientific Process
###### 13th-level Dustbringer feature
As you've grown as a Dustbringer, you've failed and stood up again more times than most do in their lives.  This gives you a unique perspective and experience on failure, allowing you to accept it as a part of life, that everything falls apart but perhaps it can be in the way you desire.

> *I accept entropy and that there are things I cannot stop and must let go of*

* **Well Tested Fabrials:** You've honed your skill as a tinkerer and inventor.  As such, your Asheons have become quite strong.  When you infuse an Asheon, you can choose to expend 4 stormlight instead of 2 to give your Asheon a 3rd level infusion.
* **Documented Failures:** You've studied your Asheon's greatly and have begun to understand their common failure points.  Your number of uses for your *No Failures Yet* feature now are restored on short rest instead of long rest.

### Destroyer of Worlds
###### 18th-level Dustbringer feature
Bringing dust into this world is what you were made to do, and how it happens is at your command.  You swear the 5th ideal from the ashes of all that stood before you

> *I will destroy all that is necessary to release a better world from it's ashes*

* You gain the ability to innately cast Meteor Swarm once per long rest.[^dustbringer3]

60 possible, 20 explicitly, 40 magic item, 12 known, 6 infused (1/2 all the way)
Known: 4->6->8->10->12
infus: 2->3->4->5->6

battlemaster
23 possible, 3->5->7->9 known, always infused

30ish weapons
-> 10 by level 18
2 every level?, start 3 with 3? then go up 2 every ideal?

* Infusing a fabrial
* Number infused
* Cost of infusing 

* Guns, they can just make guns (or fabrial devices they'll be reskinned as)
* Weapons w/ augments
  * They have a certain number of known augments from a list ( list is maybe 2 for each weapon?, use Jake's 1/short rest ideas as possible solutions)
* They are a half-caster with artificer like spells
* The abilities of the weapon augments get better over time (as they level up)

IF MISFIRE
* a bunch of different guns have misfire mechanics
* As they level up, they can put "mastery points" (idk), into the weapons, reducing their chances of mis-fire thus allowing them to specialize
  * BUT, eventually, the weapon will fail from mis-fire and then they'll have to swap to another weapon with a greater mis-fire chance
    * Make misfire reduction cost more "points" , so going from misfire <5 to <4 is like 1 point, but from <2 to <1 is like 3 points... idk

Ok -> 
    how do we incorporate stormlight into this:

    How do we make them want to take short rests:
        Each weapon an only be fixed on short rest
            (problem with this is that if weapon doesn't break, then no reason to short rest, so at higher levels... no short rest)
        Each weapon augment can only be used a fixed number of times
            (problems: giving a weapon augment that can be x # of attacks per short rest is going to be hard to balance.  Like, what can you do 3x a short rest vs 1x/ a short rest is a very different power question.)
                SOLUTION: -> 
                    Each "BIG" power is 1x/short rest, any more and it gets too powerful imo.
                    Then, each weapon(fabrial) will also be infused for {prof} # of attacks a short rest, 
                        A weapon needs to be infused in order to use its "big" feature 1x/short rest.
                    placing an augment on a weapon causes strain to accumulate on that weapon in the form of stormlight.
            could be prof bonus number of times?

Current Design:
* db (dust bringer) is going to have access to any weapon at any time (shardblade things)
* Not going to do below option, it'll be a free action swap fabrials when you summon your shardblade
  * BA is just too restrictive, spending your BA to have the opportunity to do your cool thing is lame as shit, especially considering you might do it more than once a combat (where BA rage is at least a LITTLE understandable, and newer features grant extra bonuses to it, this is just BA to have the PRIVILEGE (oh wow) to use your features, yeah, not great design)
~~* So, they will as a BA be able to swap out one fabrial for another when they change their weapon's type ->~~
* Each Fabrial is tied to a base weapon
* The db knows X different fabrial designs
* There are Y (where Y >> X) number of fabrial designs for them to chose from (think of infusions or eldrtich invocations)
* the db infuses Z where Z is subset of X fabrial designs every short rest 
  * the DB will use stormlight when they finish a short rest.
    * If they are at max say, and then finish a short rest, they CAN NOT infused before short-rest ends in order to get back their lost stormlight.
  * Infuse fabrials only stay infused until the next short rest
    * THIS MEANS THE db will always be down a bit of stormlight at the start
    * Stormlight infusions cost less at the beginning, maybe only 1 at level 1
    * But increase at higher levels (especially once the fabrials get better)
* TODO: Infusing has some benefit
* Each Fabrial design has a "signature move" associated with it.
  * (great for custom items now)
* Each Fabrial's design can only use its signature move once per short rest
* Since switching weapons costs nothing, and the more fabrials you can pick up, the more opportunity for weapon switching you have, 

-->
<!--

Two separate thoughts:
* GUNS
  * These are like, new custom items
  * Can't be used by anybody else, requires their expert knowledge
* Weapon Augments
  * These are built on the existing list of weapons
  * Can't be transferred


2nd ideal
> I will seek self mastery to protect myself from the ones I love.

TODO:
* benefits of infusing beyond being able to use them? maybe a +1 or something? or a -1 reduction to misfire 
  * But wait, misfire only triggers on the signature move...
  * HMM, maybe infusing grants a d4 but has misfire chance?
    * -> is that mathematically worth it though?
    * -> then why pick the smaller weapon, so each weaopn is jsut
    * Maybe infusing grants a small power bonus to each one
      * War-pick has + 1to armored opponents.
      * Long-sword works in a duel

## Edgedancer Order

Edgedancers channel the surges of Abrasion and Progression.  Abrasion allowing them to move elegantly and manuever around battlefields, rooftops, or farm fields without a single misstep, while Progression grants them the power to grow and heal the world by curing wounds, blooming flowers, and restoring life. They attract the most refined and articulate of people, and yet they rarely pay any attention to politics or high society, instead focusing on and listening the ordinary people of the world.  Whether it be recounting the tales of traditions to the children of a village, or remembering the face of enemy as he takes his final breath under an edgedancer's blade.

### Spren
As an edgedancer, you gain your powers through your bond with Cultivationspren.  They are the purest expression of Cultivation, the god of change and growth.  Cultivationspren typically are seen in the physical realm as a growing vine with crystals.

### Hit Points
###### 1st-level Edgedancer feature

* **Hit Die:** 1d8 per edgedancer level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per herald level after 1st

### Proficiencies
###### 1st-level Edgedancer feature

* **Armor:** Light armor, shields
* **Weapons:** Simple weapons, scimitar, shortsword
* **Tools:** Herbalism Kit
* **Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Charisma
* **Skills:** Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Medicine, Nature, Religion, Perception, Stealth

### Equipment
###### 1st-level Edgedancer feature

* (a) shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) any simple weapon
* (a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack 
* 10 darts
* Leather armor, a quarterstaff, and a herbalism kit

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 3d4x10 gp.

### Elusive Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. 

### Edgedancer Weapon Mastery
###### 1st-level Edgedancer feature

Your training as an edgedancer allows you to use the Mastery property of two kinds of weapons which you are proficient with.  Whenever you level up, you can change the weapons that you have mastery with.  You gain an additional weapon mastery at 4th and 10th level.

### Edgedancer Fighting Style
###### 1st-level Edgedancer feature

At 1st level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.  Choose one of the following options.  You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Blessed Warrior:** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. They count as edgedancer spells for you and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the cleric spell list. 
* **Blind Fighting:** You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you. 
* **Defense:** You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Druidic Warrior:** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. They count as edgedancer spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the druid spell list. 
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Improved Interceptor:** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield, a simple, or martial weapon to use this reaction.
* **Thrown Weapon Fighting:** You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon. In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
* **Two Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.
* **Unarmed Fighting:** Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.
  
  At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

#### Spell Slots

The Edgedancer Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your edgedancer spells of 1st level or higher.  To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.  You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest

You start with two 1st-level spell slots at edgedancer level 3, and gain more as you gain more edgedancer levels.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The edgedancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your edgedancer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of edgedancer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the edgedancer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of edgedancer spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your edgedancer level rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Preparing a new list of edgedancer spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. 

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your edgedancer spells.  You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.  In addition, you can use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a edgedancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use your Shardblade as a spellcasting focus for casting edgedancer spells.

### Remember the Forgotten
###### 3rd-level Edgedancer feature
You learn the Spare the Dying Cantrip

### Healing Hands Spells
###### 3rd-level Edgedancer feature
As an edgedancer, healing is your specialty and as such when you reach the respective edgedancer levels you learn the following spells and always have them prepared, and they do not count against the number of spells prepared:

| Level | Spells |
| ----- | --- |
| 3rd   | Spare the Dying, Cure Wounds, Healing Word |
| 5th   | Aid, Healing Spirit |
| 9th   | Life Transference, Mass Healing Word |
| 13th  | Aura of Life | 
| 17th  | Mass Cure Wounds, Greater Restoration | 

### Slickness
###### 3rd-level Edgedancer feature
As a bonus action you can expend one stormlight charge to become *slick* for 1 minute which gives the following benefits:
* Your movement is unaffected by difficult terrain
* Spells and other magical effects can neither reduce your speed or cause you to become paralyzed or restrained
* You can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints such as manacles or a creature that has you grappled.
* Being underwater imposes no penalties on the your movement or attacks.
* You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
* Your movement speed doubles

Additionally, while you are *slick*, at the beginning of each of your turns you can expend either one stormlight charge or gain one level of exhaustion to become *untouchable* and gain the following effects until the start of your next turn.
* You gain a +2 bonus to your AC
* You gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws
* You gain an additional action on each of your turns.  This action can be used only to Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, Use an Object action, or to cast a spell from the [Healing Hands](#Healing-Hands-Spells) spell list
* The Haste spell has no effect on you while you are *untouchable*

### Memoirs of the Forgotten
###### 6th-level Edgedancer feature
The bond with your spren and your dedication to the people of the world grows and the second ideal's words come to you.

>*I will remember those who have been forgotten*

Upon speaking the words, you gain the ability to keep a memoir of those who have been forgotten.

As a reaction when a creature dies within 60 ft of you or as an action upon physically inspecting the corpse of a creature, you can take a *memoir* of the creature.  You can only take a *memoir* of a creature once. The *memoir* you take can be something physical or mental.  Possible examples include but are not limited to: trinkets, names in a book, a mental photo library, a flower, or a rock.  You can have up to your proficiency bonus number of *memoirs* at a time.  If you attempt to gain another *memoir* when you are at your max, you must choose to release a *memoir* you already have.  The manifestation (trinket/name/memory) may not disappear, but the magical essence that makes it a *memoir* does.  You can use the *memoirs* in the following ways:

* When you make an ability check relating to the origin of a *memoir* you own (DM's discretion) you can gain advantage on an ability check relating to that check by releasing a *memoir*.
* As a part of a melee or spell attack, you can release one *memoir* to add an additional damage die to the damage roll the attack.
* When you cast a spell that restores hit points you can release one *memoir* to either add an additional die of healing to the spell cast, or to reroll any number of dice used for healing once, if you reroll a die you must use the new value rolled.
* While you have at least one *memoir* in your possession, the thought of their memory empowers you allowing you to attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Attentive Personality
###### 9th-level Edgedancer feature
At 9th level you have progressed far within the Order of Edgedancers and the following words come to you:

>*I will listen to those who have been ignored*

You gain the following abilities as you connect and listen to the people of the world

#### Inviting Presence
* Whenever you make a persuasion ability check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. 
* You always have the spell *Charm Person* prepared, at 13th level you also always have *Charm Monster* prepared.
* When you cast a spell that charms a creature, you can expend a number of stormlight charges equal to the spells level to cause the targets of the spell to have disadvantage on the saving throw to resist the charm effects.

#### Everlasting Memory
* You gain the ability to channel your stormlight into expended memoirs to reinvigorate them with life.  As a bonus action you can expend 3 stormlight charges to create a memoir from the memory of a memoir you've released previously.

<!-- Ideas: -->
<!-- * Charm person, but the monster makes the roll straight when fighitng, disadvantage if not fighting. -->
<!-- * You gain proficiency in persuasion, if you already have proficiency in persuasion you gain expertise, if you already have expertise, you gain expertise in another skill you are proficient with. -->
<!-- * As a bonus action, you can give a memoir to another creature and they can expend the memoir they recieve in the usual way syou can use a memoir. -->
<!-- * As a reaction when a willing ally within 30 ft that you can see makes an ability check, attack roll, or casts a spell that restores hit points, you can apply the relevant effect of your Memoir of the Forgotten ability to the triggering effect. -->


### Slip from the Mind
###### 13th-level Edgedancer feature
<!-- Maybe expand upon this -->
You become a master within the Order of Edgedancers.  The fourth ideal comes to you:

>*I will recognize there are some so evil, forgetting their memory will save others*

* When you are targeted by an attack, you can expend 2 stormlight charges to cause that attack to have disadvantage (no action required)

### Tree of Life
###### 18th-level Edgedancer feature
You become an embodiment of healing and good will. The fifth and final ideal comes to you:

>*I will never forget what makes this world worth living*

As an action, you can go into your tree of life form.  While in this form you gain the following benefits
* You gain the effects of the foresight spell 
* When you begin your turn you can choose to be *slick* and/or *untouchable* with no stormlight cost
* You gain a healing aura that expands 30 ft out from you and is centered on you
  * All creatures you choose who begin their turn within your aura or when they enter your aura for the first time on their turn, who have at least one hit point can regain 5 hit points.
  * Additionally, all unconscious creatures within the aura are automatically stabilized.

## Truthwatcher Order
Truthwatcher's tend to live more solitary lives, mostly spent with their heads down in a library or a tomb seeking out truths, especially older truths that may have been forgotten.  They seek to find the fundamental truths of the universe, and if they learn something important or valuable, they share it with the rest of the world.  greatly concerned with the actions of the powerful and might be likened to investigative reporters. The order will make their opinions known loudly and forcefully, particularly if they think someone in power is abusing that power or lying about fundamental truths. They tend to attract scientists, scholars, or thinkers of all types. 

### Spren
As a truthwatcher, your powers are bound to mistspren.  In the material world, they are most similar to the shimmer light makes when it is reflected through a crystal.  When they stay still, light grows upwards from them in the shape of plants, which retreats when they start to move.

In general they are curious; the idea of seeing something through a new perspective, or finding out how other creatures think, seems interesting to them.

### Hit Points
###### 1st-level Truthwatcher feature

* **Hit Die:** 1d6 per truthwatcher Level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 6 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per herald level after 1st

### Proficiencies
###### 1st-level Truthwatcher feature

* **Armor:** None
* **Weapons:** Simple melee weapons
* **Tools:** [Fortune Telling Tools](#fortune-telling-tools)
* **Saving Throws:** Intelligence, Wisdom
* **Skills:** Choose three skills from Arcana, Animal Handling, Deception, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Persuasion, Religion

### Equipment
###### 1st-level Truthwatcher feature

* any simple weapon
* (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus
* (a) diplomat's pack or (b) a scholar's pack
* Two daggers and [Fortune telling tools](#fortune-telling-tools)

Alternatively, you can ignore the equipment from your class and background, and start with 3d4 x 10 gp.

### Truthwatcher Order Ability Score
###### 1st-level Truthwatcher feature
When you become a truthwatcher, you must choose your Order Ability Score.  It can be either Intelligence or Wisdom.  When truthwatcher abilities say to use your Order Ability Score, use the ability score you chose here for those features.

At your DM's discretion you may change your Order Ability Score when you gain a level in this class, though it should not be something that is changed often.

### Truthwatcher Spellcasting
###### 1st-level Truthwatcher feature

Through your bond with your spren you gain the ability to cast powerful spells as described below:

| Level | Cantrips Known | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th |
| ---- | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |

| 18th | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 19th | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 20th | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |

#### Cantrips
You learn three cantrips: [Lecture](#lecture), and two other cantrips of your choice from the [Truthwatcher spell list](#truthwatcher-spell-list). You learn additional truthwatcher cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 4th cantrip at 4th level and a 5th at 10th level.  You can replace one cantrip you know with another from the truthwatcher spell list when you gain a level in this class.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The truthwatcher Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your truthwatcher spells of 1st level or higher.  To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.  You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest

As a truthwatcher, you have every spell in your spell list prepared at all times.  Any spell in your spell list can be cast by you as long as you have the spell slots to cast it.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Your [Order Ability Score](#truthwatcher-order-ability-score) is your spellcasting ability for your truthwatcher spells.  You use your Order Ability Score whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.  In addition, you can use your Order Ability Score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a truthwatcher spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Order Ability Score modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Order Ability Score modifier

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast a truthwatcher spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag, you have the spell prepared, and it is not a spell gained through your [Historical Research](#historical-research) feature.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use [Fortune telling tools](#fortune-telling-tools) as a spellcasting focus for casting truthwatcher spells.

### Historical Research
###### 1st-level Truthwatcher feature
As a life-long scholar you spend much of your time researching and as such have discovered how to cast spells from outside of your area of expertise as a truthwatcher.

Starting at 1st level you learn two spells from any spell list and add them to your *Researched List*.  Spells on your *Researched List* are truthwatcher spells for you and are considered prepared, though they are not on the truthwatcher spell list.  

Each spell on your *Researched List* can only be cast once per long rest.  Casting a spell from your *Researched List* requires you to expend a spell slot and stormlight equal to the spell slot's level.  You can cast the spell at any level for which you have slots, but once you cast a spell from your *Researched List*, you cannot cast that spell again until you take a long rest.

You can cast a spells from your *Researched List* a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Additionally, when you gain a new level in this class, you learn one additional spell and can add it to your *Researched List* and can swap out any number of spells in your *Researched List* for any other spell.  Swapping out spells in your *Researched List* can only be done when you gain a level in this class, not long rest.

### Clairvoyant Healing
###### 3rd-level Truthwatcher feature
When you swear your first ideal as a truthwatcher, your stormlight abilities begin to manifest:

* When you use your Stormlight Restoration feature, you can target any willing creature you can touch rather than only targeting yourself.
* Additionally, when you heal a creature using your Stormlight Restoration feature, you can choose to give that creature Inspiration[^truthwatcher1].  You can grant Inspiration in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

### Predictive Protection
###### 6th-level Truthwatcher feature
You swear the 2nd ideal of the truthwatchers, and you delve further into your study and discovery of truths amongst the natural world

> *I will seek truths wherever they hide*

When you or an ally within 30 feet is targeted by an attack or is forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend stormlight to cast a protective abjuration spell listed below.  You must expend stormlight equal to the value listed under the Stormlight Cost column in the table below in addition to the spell slot required for the spell.  Additionally, if the spell has a range of touch, its range is increased to 30 feet.

| Spell Name | Stormlight Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Dispel Evil and Good | 6 |
| Fizban's Platinum Shield | 10 |
| Freedom of Movement | 2 |
| Intellect Fortress | 3 |
| Mind Blank | 10 |
| Primordial Ward | 8 | 
| Protection from Energy | 4 |
| Protection from Evil and Good | 3 |
| Protection from Poison | 2 | 
| Stoneskin | 5 |
| Warding Bond | 3 |

### Draw from the Past
###### 9th-level Truthwatcher feature
When you speak the 3rd ideal of the truthwatchers you recognize the powers and knowledge that truth's from the past can hold and help guide to future.

> *I will reveal truths so long as it is right*

You gain the following features by attuning to knowledge from the past:
* **Expertise:** You gain expertise in one skill which you have proficiency in, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it.  The skill you choose must be one that isn't already benefitting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your proficiency bonus.
* **Experience History:** You gain the ability to call upon the spirits of the world in order to relieve a moment in history through the eyes of a spirit who experienced the event.  To do so, you must spend 1 minute in ritual practice, at the end of which you expend 5 stormlight to be mentally transported back in time to a vision of the past.  You will perceive this vision through the eyes of a creature who experienced it and will last as long as the spirits see fit for you to gain the knowledge you sought.  No matter how long the vision lasts for you, only 1 round passes to all outside observers.
* **Library of Knowledge:** As an action, you can expend 3 stormlight to extract knowledge you've gained over the course of your studies and share it with a willing creature you can touch.  When you do so, choose one skill in which you are proficient or expertised in, the targeted creature gains the same level of proficiency in that skill if they aren't already, until you take a long rest.
  * For example, if you are proficient (or expertised) in stealth and share your proficiency in stealth with another creature who isn't proficient, that creature gains proficiency (or expertise) in that skill and when they make stealth checks (until your next long rest) they add their Dexterity bonus and their proficiency bonus(es) to the roll.

  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

### Combat Premonition
###### 13th-level Truthwatcher feature
Your ability to see truth has begun to spread to seeing the future, as such you see what needs to be said as you speak the fourth ideal

> *I know truths that cannot be shared*

Upon speaking these words, you are constantly aware of your surroundings, and thus can't be surprised while conscious.  Additionally, when you roll initiative, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Future Truths
###### 18th-level Truthwatcher feature
As you speak the final words, your awareness of the world is unparalleled, you live your life a few seconds ahead of all other creatures.

> *I see all truths*

When you start your turn, you can choose to expend 4 stormlight charges to gain the benefits of the *foresight* spell.  The effect of the spell lasts until the start of your next turn.

<!-- #### Cantrips:
Current ideas, get every spell listed below
PROBLEM: Very passive, what can they do on their turn?  Maybe add a few more psychic spells

At level 1, you learn 2 spells from any spell list (at a level for which you have slots) and add them to your "Spell Notes" which is a list of spells you've discovered over time through your studies.  Each spell in your spell notes can only be cast once per long rest.  Casting a spell from your Spell Notes requires you to expend a spell slot and stormlight equal to the spell slot's level. You can cast the spell at any level for which you have slots, but once you cast a spell from your "Spell Notes" you cannot cast that spell again until you take a long rest.

When you level up, you learn 1 additional spell and can add them to your "Spell Notes", additionally, you can swap out any number of spells in your "Spell Notes" for any other spell for which you have spell slots for.  Swapping out spells in your "Spell Notes" can only be done on level up, not long rest.

## Lightweaver Order
Lightweaver's live their lives on the razor's edge of deception.  Whether that deception is used to create beautiful artwork that transports the viewer to another world, or to build illusions to allow for deception, espionage, and subterfuge.  To build these illusions, their oaths revolve around speaking powerful truths about themselves, often deep personal realizations about their own lives that most people would choose to ignore, for understanding truths is what allows them create lies that can masquerade as truths even to the most trained eye.

Lightweavers are most interested in the arts, including all kinds of visual arts and theater.  They range widely in personality from the quiet and introspective painter to the gregarious stage performer, with everything in between.  What unites them tends to be a love of art, the importance of entertainment, beauty, and art in a person's life, and striving to make sure that the world doesn't just live through any danger, because mere survival isn't enough unless there is something to live for.

### Spren
As a lightweaver, you gain your powers through Cryptics.  Cryptics are creatures of logic, and they enjoy learning about truths and the lies that can be weaved between them.  The more powerful the truths the more likely powerful lies are to exist in the cracks.  Cryptics in the material plane appears as constantly shifting patterns of lines, shapes, or other manifestations.  When you try to look at one, it is impossible to fully grasp the entire shape of the pattern as it is constantly shifting and changing, and there are always more details to be found in their scintillating shape.

### Hit Points
###### 1st-level Lightweaver feature

* **Hit Die:** 1d8 per lightweaver Level
* **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
* **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) per herald level after 1st

* **Skills:** Choose three skills from Deception, Insight, Investigation, Performance, Persuasion, Slight of Hand, Stealth

| 20th | 6 | 16 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 |

#### Cantrips
You learn four cantrips: [Illusory Onslaught](#illusory-onslaught), Minor Illusion, and two other cantrips of your choice from the [Lightweaver spell list](#lightweaver-spell-list).  You learn additional lightweaver cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 5th cantrip at 4th level and a 6th at 10th level. You can replace one cantrip you know with another from the lightweaver spell list when you gain a level in this class.

#### Spell Slots
The Lightweaver Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your lightweaver spells of 1st level or higher.  To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.  You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest

<!-- You start with two 1st-level spell slots at level 1, and gain more as you gain more lightweaver levels. -->

#### Spells Known
You know three 1st level [lightweaver spells](#lightweaver-spell-list) of your choice.  Additionally you always know the spell *Disguise Self* and it doesn't count against your number of lightweaver spells known.

The Spells Known column of the Lightweaver Spellcasting table shows when you learn more lightweaver spells of 1st level or higher.  Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.   For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Whenever you take a long rest you can replace one of the lightweaver spells you know with another spell of your choice from the lightweaver spell list.  The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your lightweaver spells.  You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.  In addition, you can use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a lightweaver spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast any lightweaver spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. 

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use your Shardtool, artisan tool, or musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for casting Lightweaver spells.

### Shardtool
###### 3rd-level Lightweaver feature which replaces the Shardblade feature

At 3rd level, your bond to your spren has evolved to the point where you gain the ability to summon them in the material plane. You can use your action to summon your Shardtool in your empty hand.  The Shardtool acts as a spellcasting focus for your spells.  You can choose the form that this tool takes each time you create it. The form of the tool must be a tool with which you are proficient.

Your Shardtool disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the tool (no action required), or if you die.

#### Absorb Magic Tool
You also gain the ability to absorb magic tools which you are proficient with and meld them into your shardtool.  You can absorb a magic tool into your shardtool by performing a special ritual while you hold the tool. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.  You can't affect an artifact or a sentient tool in this way.  Once completed, when you summon your shardtool, you can instead choose to summon the magical tool you absorbed which acts as your shardtool, but doesn't gain the benefits of being Awakened, Ascendant or Exalted.  You can dismiss this tool into an extradimensional space as if it were your shardtool.  You can only absorb one magical tool at a time. The magical tool ceases to be absorbed by your shardtool if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different tool, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The tool appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. 

#### Awakened Shardtool
###### 7th-level Lightweaver feature which replaces the Awakened Shardblade feature

At 7th level you become more attuned with your spren and your Shardtool becomes more responsive to your commands. Any tool you create with your Shardtool feature has a +1 bonus to its spell attack rolls and damage dealt by spell attacks.

#### Ascendant Shardtool
###### 11th-level Lightweaver feature which replaces the Ascendant Shardblade feature

At 11th level your bond with your spren has grown significantly. Any tool you create with your Shardtool feature has a +2 bonus to its spell attack rolls and damage dealt by spell attacks.

#### Exalted Shardtool
###### 15th-level Lightweaver feature which replaces the Exalted Shardblade feature

At 15th level your bond with your spren has grown to new heights. Any tool you create with your Shardtool feature has a +3 bonus to its spell attack rolls and damage dealt by spell attacks.

### Lightweaver Ideals
Lightweaver's are different from every other order in that their ideals are not rigid or standard in any way other than the first ideal which is identical across all orders.  For the second through fifth ideals, lightweavers speak individual truths about themselves which are truths that the lightweaver might not want to recognize or acknowledge, but are necessary in order for them to learn to distinguish between real truths and the lies they can create to cover them up.

When you speak your ideals at 6th, 9th, 13th, and 18th level, it should be a truth about yourself that is difficult to confront but allows you to understand truths and your powers more.

There are a few examples of ideals from the Stormlight Archives in the Footnotes below (SPOILERS BEWARE)[^lightweaver1]

### Stormlight Powered Illusions
###### 3rd-level Lightweaver feature

When you cast an *illusion* spell that has a duration that is greater than or equal to 10 minutes, you can choose to expend a number of stormlight charges equal to the spell's level to cast the spell without expending a spell slot.  The spell still requires material components that are consumed upon casting.

### Improved Minor Illusion
###### 3rd-level Lightweaver feature

When you cast Minor Illusion, you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell. 

### Personal Disguise
###### 3rd-level Lightweaver feature

You can cast disguise self using a stormlight charge instead of a spell slot.  Additionally, when you cast disguise self, you can expend one additional stormlight charge to give it a range of touch.  Any creature you touch with this ability must be willing.  

You can only have your proficiency bonus number of Personal Disguise's cast at once (including disguise self cast on yourself).  If you use Personal Disguise when you already have your maximum reached, the oldest casting of disguise self ends immediately.

### Stormlight Empowered Illusions
###### 6th-level Lightweaver feature

When you cast a lightweaver illusion spell, you can expend one charge per spell level to extend the duration according to the table below.  Illusion cantrips can be extended at no cost.

| Spell Duration | Extended Duration |
| --- | --- |
| 1 Round | 2 Rounds |
| 1 Minute | 2 Minutes |
| 10 Minutes | 1 Hour | 
| 1 Hour | 2 Hours |
| 8 Hours | 24 Hours |
| 12 Hours | 24 Hours |
| 24 Hours | 7 Days |
| 10 Days | 30 Days |
| Until Dispelled | Until Dispelled |

### Malleable Illusions
###### 6th-level Lightweaver feature

Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using the spell's normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion. 

### Body of Lies
###### 9th-level Lightweaver feature

When you are hit by an attack roll you can see, you can use your reaction to expend 5 stormlight charges to summon an illusory duplicate of yourself in your space.  When you do so, the triggering attack automatically misses you and the illusion then dissipates.  Additionally, you may teleport up to 10 feet away to an unoccupied space that you can see.[^lightweaver2]

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Intimate Riposte
###### 9th-level Lightweaver feature

As you become more comfortable with the truth's you've awakened in yourself you've gained the ability to see through lies that others make to conceal the dark intimate truths they dare not even acknowledge, and to use those truths as leverage.  As an action, you magically telepathically communicate with a creature within 30 feet of you.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC.  The target automatically succeeds on the save if it is a construct.  On a successful saving throw this attempted infiltration has no effect.

On a failed saving throw, you pierce the mind of the creature you target and extract a powerful intimate truth the target fears to acknowledge.  You gain no knowledge of this secret as it is a jumbled mess of memories and emotions, but the target is convinced you know it, and that you will share the secret if they cause harm to you.

The first time in the next minute, you are attacked, damaged, or targeted by a harmful spell or effect cast by the target who's secret you hold, you can riposte by revealing their secret to the world.  Everybody but the target hears nothing, but the target is emotionally and psychologically wrecked by this truth that you reveal, and they take 9d12 psychic damage, and the effect ends.

When the effect ends, the creature realizes that your knowledge of their intimate truth was only an illusion, and they have no understanding of why it held you in such fear.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. 

### Omnipotent Illusions
###### 13th-level Lightweaver feature

As an action you can cast Mirage Arcane and Project Image each once per long rest without expending a spell slot.

### Illusory Army
###### 18th-level Lightweaver feature

You learn the spell [Army of the Mind](#army-of-the-mind), it is a lightweaver spell and it doesn't count against your number known lightweaver spells.

Amongst the orders of Knights Radiant, they are some of the most scholarly along with the Truthwatchers.

### Spren
With oily black skin and angular features, Inkspren are the spren behind the Nahel Bond required to create an elsecaller.  They tend to dislike humans for their irrational and unchanging nature but have formed bonds with humans who are capable of being cautious, logical, and unemotional.

#### Cantrips

You learn four cantrips of your choice from the [Elsecaller spell list](#elsecaller-spell-list).  You learn additional elsecaller cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 5th cantrip at 4th level and 6th at 10th level. You can replace one cantrip you know with another from the elsecaller spell list when you gain a level in this class.

#### Inkspren Archive
At 1st level, you form a bond with your spren, an Inkspren, which becomes the home of your arcane archive.  Your archive of arcane knowledge is stored within the mind of your spren and thus only you can access the knowledge stored there via your connection with your spren. Upon formation of your bond, your archive contains six 1st level elsecaller spells of your choice.  Your archive is the repository of the elsecaller spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

The spells you add to your inkspren archive as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse.  You might find other spells during your adventures.  You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil mage's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.

An inkspren archive doesn't contain cantrips.

* **Copying a Spell into your archive:** When you find an [Elsecaller spell](#elsecaller-spell-list) of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your archive if it is a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it

    Copying a spell into your archive involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the spellcasters who wrote it.  You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your archive using your own notation.  When you have mastered the spell enough to cast it, your spren forms a connection with your current memory and stores it in the archive, thus allowing you at future dates to recall your current understanding to quickly re-remember how to cast said spell.

    For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and has no cost as your inkspren provides the material components required to experiment and record the spell into your archive.

    An elsecaller spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied.  When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level.  If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied.  Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.

* **Restoring the Archive:** If your bond with your spren is broken at any time, the knowledge stored in your inkspren archive is maintained by the spren.  If in the future you are able to restore your bond with your spren, the knowledge stored within the Inkspren archive is maintained and can be accessed by you again.  If you bond a different spren, your spells learned and stored with your other spren are lost.  See [Nahel Bond](#nahel-bond) and associated rules for spren for more info.

* **Destroying the Archive:** Destroying the archive is only possible if your spren is killed.  See [Breaking a Nahel Bond](#breaking-a-nahel-bond) for more information.

* **Replacing the Archive:**  Your inkspren archive is stored within your spren.  If your previous spren was killed, all knowledge of spells stored within your spren are lost.  Upon bonding a new spren, you could begin rebuilding your archive anew.  Any spells you have prepared can be transcribed into a new archive using the rules for Copying a spell above.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Elsecaller table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher.  To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of elsecaller spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of elsecaller spells from your inkspren archive equal to your Intelligence modifier + your elsecaller level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  

Spells for which you have spell slots are designated by a number (even if that value is 0).  At higher levels you will begin to lose lower level spell slots.  When you lose these spell slots you can still prepare spells of that level you will just likely have to cast them using a higher level slot. [^elsecaller1]

For example, if you're a 3rd-level elsecaller, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your inkspren archive. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Magic Missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of elsecaller spells requires time spent recalling information from your archive as you restore the memories of understanding you created when you first copied the spell into your archive.  The time to store your current memories and recall other memories from the archive requires at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. 

#### Learning Spells of 1st Level or Higher

Each time you gain an elsecaller level, you can add two elsecaller spells of your choice to your archive. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Elsecaller Spellcasting table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your inkspren archive.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your elsecaller spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an elsecaller spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

***Spell save DC*** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

***Spell Attack modifier*** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Ritual Casting
You can cast an elsecaller spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your archive. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your elsecaller spells. 

#### Spell Slots

You know four 1st level [elsecaller spells](#elsecaller-spell-list) of your choice.

At higher levels, the elsecaller spellcasting table will show you how many spell slots of 1st level or higher that you have.  As an elsecaller, at higher levels you will lose some of your lower level spell slots.  This does not remove your ability to cast lower level spells, only the spell slots.  Each spell that you learn as you level up, must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

### Stormlight Empowered Spells
###### 3rd-level Elsecaller feature
When you swear your first ideal as a Knight Radiant of the Elsecallers at 3rd level, you gain powers through your stormlight which to enhance your arcane prowess:

**Forceful Spells:** By expending one stormlight when you begin casting a spell, you can add your intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any elsecaller spell you cast.

**Stormlight Well:** Starting at 3rd level, you can restore your arcane wells of power with stormlight. When you complete a short rest, you can expend a number of stormlight charges to regain an expended spell slot.  The amount expended for each level of slot is listed in the table below.  Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you expend the spell slot that you regained with this feature.[^elsecaller2] 

Once you regain a slot of a given level, you cannot regain another slot of that same level until you finish a long rest.  You can only regain a slot of a given level if you meet the level requirement as specified in the Level Requirement column below.[^elsecaller3]
<!-- and already have slots of that level -->

| Stormlight Expended | Spell Slot Level | Level Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2  | 1 | 3rd
| 3  | 2 | 3rd
| 5  | 3 | 6th
| 8  | 4 | 9th
| 14 | 5 | 9th
| 18 | 6 | 13th
| 22 | 7 | 13th
| 26 | 8 | 18th
| 35 | 9 | 18th

### Soulcast Spells
###### 6th-level Elsecaller feature
At 6th level, you speak the second ideal of the elsecallers.

>*I swear to seek a higher calling, to dedicate myself to it*

When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 3 stormlight charges to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder. When you reach 13th level, force damage is added to the above list of damage types you can change between.

### Shardplate of the Commander
###### 9th-level Elsecaller feature
Upon speaking the third ideal of the elsecallers, you learn to draw experience from those around you, especially those in the world of martial skills.

>*I will not steal accomplishments of those unaware, if I am to reach my calling it will be by my skill alone*

Once per long rest, you can use your bonus action to don your shardplate made of logicspren.  For the next minute you gain the following benefits:

* Your AC cannot be less than 17 as your shardplate protects you.  Your AC increases to 18 and 19 when you reach the 4th and 5th ideals respectively.
* You gain proficiency with all simple and martial melee weapons.
* When you make an attack with your shardblade, you can choose to use your Intelligence instead of Strength for the attacks and damage rolls of the shardblade.
* The following spells are considered elsecaller spells that are known by you and don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
  * Green-Flame Blade
  * Booming Blade
  * Swordburst
  * [Arctic Gale](#arctic-gale)
  * [Capacitor](#capacitor)
  * [Draft of Movement](#draft-of-movement)
  * [Terran Strike](#terran-strike)

### Shadesmar
###### 13th-level Elsecaller feature
Your mastery over the cognitive realm has grown greatly and thus you are ready to swear the 4th ideal of the elsecallers

>*I will see the value in wisdom of others, even if they are wrong*

As you come to realize you are too valuable to leave yourself defenseless in the event that you are struck down, you gain the ability to travel to shadesmar while on deaths door.  You learn the cantrip [Shadesmar Hideaway](#shadesmar-hideaway).  

Additionally, when you are forced to make a death saving throw, you can instead choose to expend 6 stormlight charges or a spell slot of 4th level or higher in order to become stabilized and use the **Activation** feature of your Shadesmar Hideaway spell.  Using the Activation feature of this cantrip requires no components.

Once you activate your Shadesmar Hideaway spell in this way, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Shadesmar Storm
###### 18th-level Elsecaller feature
You have become a master of this world and an expert in manipulating matter and shadesmar like clay, as such the fifth ideal comes naturally to you.

>*I acknowledge that lies have their place for serving the greater good*

You learn the spell [Shadesmar Storm](#shadesmar-storm) which doesn't count against your number of prepared spells but is always prepared.

## Stoneward Order
The Stonewards are seen as the infantry and ground troops of the Knights Radiants alongside Windrunners.  They tended to attract people interested in warfare, but also challenge, prowess with weapons and athleticism.  Throughout the world, they were widely known for being dependable, strong and filled with resolve.

In battle, they served as the frontline troops.  In times of peace, on the other hand, they were often explorers, but also sportsmen, often organizing and engaging in various competitions and events.

### Spren
The spren of the stonewards are Peakspren, they tend to appear as rocks or stone creatures who wear human clothing and tend to be bald with their heads sporting more cracks than the ret of their bodies.

Some Stoneward abilities and spells will require your Stoneward DC which is calculated as 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you. 
* **Defense:** You gain a +1 bonus to AC.
* **Druidic Warrior:** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. They count as stoneward spells for you, and Constitution is your spellcasting ability for them.

* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

* **Improved Interceptor:** When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier (to a minimum of 0 damage).

### Vorin Stances
###### 3rd-level Stoneward feature
Upon being knighted as a fledgling stoneward, your path begins with the extensive training in the different methods of mastering your shardblade, also known as vorin stances.  Each stance has it's strengths and weaknesses and it is common for different shardbearers to favor one or two stances, but to be proficient in many in order to best suit their combat situation.

To begin your training, you learn two vorin stances.  When you swear your greater oaths at higher levels, you will learn additional vorin stances and gain infusions to upgrade the stances you know.  How many you have of each is shown in the Vorin Stances and Infusions columns of the Stoneward Table.

You can switch out one stance you know for another one on level up.

### Shardplate
###### 3rd-level Stoneward feature
As a Bonus Action on your turn, you can expend one stormlight charge to summon stormlight infused shardplate around your body, granting yourself temporary hit points equal to your constitution modifier.  For every additional stormlight charge you expend, add an additional 1d12 temporary hit points to the total gained with this bonus action.  These temporary hit points disappear when you finish a short or long rest.
 
### Roots of Stone
###### 3rd-level Stoneward feature
You learn the basics of how to control the earth around you and gain the ability to cast the spell Earth Tremor as a Bonus Action by expending 1 stormlight.  You can expend up to your proficiency bonus number of additional charges to increase the spell's level by one for each additional charge. 

You are immune to any difficult terrain created by this spell, and while casting you can expend any number of stormlight charges to allow you to choose that same number of creatures to be immune to the damage and difficult terrain created by this spell.

### Shifting Earth
###### 6th-level Stoneward feature
Your bond with your peakspren is beginning to grow allowing you to stand more freely within your stone form as the second ideal's words come to you.

> *I will stand where other's fall*

Upon speaking the words, you gain the following abilities to help you in combat and as a wielder of the earth

* **Extra Attack:** You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
* **Earthen Spells** You gain the ability to cast Maximilian's Earthen Grasp, Meld Into Stone, and Erupting Earth by expending one, two, or three stormlight charges respectively.
* **Infusions** You gain the ability to infuse your vorin stances with stormlight.  Your number of infusions are listed in the Infusions Column in the [Stoneward Table](#stoneward-table).  Over the course of a short or long rest you can change which stances you infuse by expending 2 stormlight for each infused stance.  When a stance is infused, you can used the additional ***Infused*** properties that are listed within the stance's description.

### Rockshaper
###### 9th-level Stoneward feature
Through your trials together, the bond with your spren has grown strong enough that you can begin to shape rock and stone beyond their natural limits and the third ideal comes to you:

> *I will not fall even in defeat*

And as you speak those words, your attunement with the earth grows further allowing you to cast Move Earth, Stone Shape, or Transmute Rock by expending four, five, or four stormlight charges respectively.  Additionally you are immune to all magical and nonmagical difficult terrain created by rocks, stones, gems, and other similar materials

### Stoneheart
###### 13th-level Stoneward feature
You become a master of stone and rock as the fourth ideal comes to you:

> *I will fall for those I love*  

In speaking the fourth ideal, your attunement with the earth expands as you gain Tremorsense[^stoneward1] out to a range of 30 ft and immunity to the petrified condition.  Additionally you learn to channel your earthen heart to cast Flesh to Stone, Investiture of Stone, and Wall of Stone by expending three, five, or seven stormlight charges respectively. Finally you gain the ability to Earth Glide.

### Oils:
Oils are powerful energies that are created using stormlight energy.  Knowing an enemies weaknesses allows you to use the proper oils for a fight which can result in devastating amounts of damage.

When you hit a creature with a weapon that has oil on it, you deal an additional 1d4 of the corresponding Oil Damage Type.  If the creature has resistance or immunity to the Reactive Damage Type associated with the applied oil you hit the creature with, the creature becomes vulnerable to the Oil's Damage Type for the  the triggering attack.

| Oil Name | Oil Damage Type | Reactive Damage Type | Oil Rarity | Level Requirement | 
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Frost Oil | Cold | Fire | Common | 3rd |
| Flame Oil | Fire | Cold | Common | 3rd |
| Toxic Oil | Poison | Acid | Uncommon | 3rd |
| Acridic Oil | Acid | Poison | Uncommon | 3rd |
| Rupture Oil | Thunder | Lightning | Rare | 6th |
| Tempest Oil | Lightning | Thunder | Rare | 6th |
| Death Oil | Necrotic | Radiant | Very Rare | 9th |
| Holy Oil | Radiant | Necrotic | Very Rare | 9th |
| Eldritch Oil | Psychic | Force | Legendary | 12th |
| Blast Oil | Force | Psychic | Legendary | 12th |

#### Examples: 
*All examples will be done by an attacker with a +3 Dexterity mod, wielding a shortsword with Frost Oil applied to it, and the targeted creature will only have the listed resistances, immunities, and/or vulnerabilities*
* You hit a creature with no resistances/immunities/vulnerabilities
  * This creature would take 1d6 + 3 piercing damage and 1d4 cold damage.
* You hit a creature with cold resistance (or immunity)
  * This creature would take 1d6 + 3 piercing damage and 1d4 / 2 (rounded down) cold damage (or no cold damage if it were immune).
* You hit a creature with fire resistance (or immunity)
  * This creature would take 1d6 + 3 piercing damage + 2 * 1d4 cold damage.
* You hit a creature with fire resistance (or immunity) and cold resistance (or immunity)
  * This creature would take 1d6 + 3 piercing damage + 1d4 cold damage with the cold resistance and vulnerability canceling each other out (or no cold damage if the creature is immune to cold damage)
* You hit a creature with fire resistance (or immunity) and vulnerability to cold damage
  * This creature would take 1d6 + 3 piercing damage + 2 * 1d4 cold damage (vulnerability does not "stack").

## New Spells

The spells listed here are primarily for use with the Herald class but may be adapted or used by other classes, although balance is not guaranteed.

### Army of the Mind
*9th-level illusion*

* **Casting Time:** 1 action
* **Range:** 90 ft.
* **Component:** V, S
* **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute.

You reach into the ethereal plane and pull from magic in the air to weave an army of illusory warriors at a point you choose within range.

When you cast the spell you may designate any number of creatures within a 30-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on that point to be protected by the illusory army.  When a creature is protected they gain the following benefits:

* 10 temporary hit points
* An illusory bodyguard
  * When a protected creature is targeted by an attack, roll any single die, on an even value, the illusory bodyguard becomes the target of the attack, the duplicate has an AC of 10.  On an odd value you remain the target of the attack.  If an attack hits a bodyguard, the bodyguard is destroyed.

As a bonus action on subsequent turns you can move the spell up to 60 feet to a space you can see and refresh the effects of your spell.  When you refresh the spell, creatures you designate in the spell's current area are protected and gain 10 temporary hit points and an illusory bodyguard if they don't already have one.  Creatures who were previously protected by the spell do not lose their protection when the spell is refreshed even if they are not currently in the spell's area.

A creature attacking a target of this spell is unaffected by the illusory bodyguard if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

When the spell ends, the illusory army, bodyguards, and temporary hit points are destroyed.

### Arctic Gale
*Evocation cantrip*

* **Casting Time:** 1 action
* **Range:** Self (5-foot radius)
* **Component:** S, M (a weapon worth at least 1 sp)
* **Duration:** Instantaneous

You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you.  On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and a howl of arctic wind rushes in behind the weapon attack.  Any creatures in a 15 foot cone behind the target of the attack must make a Constitution saving throw and take 1d6 cold damage on fail, or no damage on success.

The spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels.  At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 cold damage to the target on a hit and the cold damage to the creatures in the cone increases to 2d6.  Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th and 17th level.

On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and they are charged with lightning energy until the start of your next turn.  The next attack that hits the target before the start of your next turn, adds an additional 1d6 lightning damage to the damage roll, and another creature of your choice within 30 ft. must make a Dexterity saving throw and take 1d10 lightning damage on fail, or no damage on success.

The spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels.  At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 lightning damage to the target on a hit and the lightning damage to the second creature increases to 2d10.  Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 and 1d10 at 11th level (2d6 and 3d10) and 17th level (3d6 and 4d10) respectively.

* **Duration:** Instantaneous, up to 8 hours.

When targeting an object you can infuse the surge of division into it allowing you to modify and destroy the object depending on its material.  You can burn intricate designs into the object or create torchlight from the object depending on its material.

You can only have one object infused with the surge of division at a time.  You must maintain concentration while burning intricate designs into an object.  The area you can modify at one time is limited to a 5ft cube.  You must also remain in contact with the object you are burning designs into or creating torchlight with for the duration.  If you lose contact with the object, you can recast this spell to pickup the duration from where it left off.  Once an object has been used for torchlight for its duration the object is disintegrated and cannot be recovered.  Torchlight created by objects sheds bright light for 20 feet and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

| Metal | 1 Hour | 1 Hour |
| Gems or Crystal | 1 Hour | 8 Hours
| Adamantine, Mithral, Magical Objects | N/A | N/A


When targeting a creature, you make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach.  On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then becomes infected with the surge of division until the start of your next turn.  Whenever the target *encourages entropy* by using an action, a legendary action, or willingly moves 30ft, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage as their body begins to fail and decay under the stress of accelerated entropy.

The spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels.  At 5th level, the melee weapon attack does an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, and the damage the target takes for encouraging entropy increases to 2d6.  Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th level (2d6 and 3d6) and again at 17th level (3d6 and 4d6).

While the target is surrounded by these winds, they cannot make opportunity attacks.

The spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels.  At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 slashing damage to the target on a hit.  This damage roll increases by 1d8 again at 11th and 17th level.

*Inspiration Source: [u/arllll on r/dndnext](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/d7uyq0/homebrew_weapon_attack_cantrips_in_the_vein_of/)*

### Hand of Judgment
*5th-level transmutation*

* **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
* **Range:** Self
* **Component:** V, S
* **Duration:** 1 minute.

You look down upon your hands, and recognize that before you lie two paths of judgment.  Your right, being the hand of waiting, your left being the hand of action.

When you cast this spell, and at the beginning of your turn on future rounds, you can choose whether to use your left or right hand for judgment.  Whichever hand you choose, you gain that hand's benefits until the start of your next turn.

* **Left Hand:** Whenever you are struck by an opponent's melee attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack at that opponent.
* **Right Hand:** Whenever you spend your action dodging in combat, you accumulate one ***judgment***.  

When you make a successful attack while under the effects of the Hand of Judgment spell, you can expend one ***judgment*** to turn that normal hit into a critical hit.  You can expend your ***judgment*** when you are using either hand and stored ***judgments*** disappear when the Hand of Judgment spell ends.

### Illusory Onslaught

However you lecture them, the less intelligent they are, the more effective the lecture is.  

The target must make an intelligence saving throw on fail they take psychic damage dependent on their intelligence. (damage dice used based on the target's intelligence)

## New Tools

The tools listed here are primarily for use with the Herald class but may be adapted or used by other classes, although balance is not guaranteed.

### Fortune Telling Tools
Fortune teller’s tools take many different forms, with each fortune telling practitioner using the tools that work best for them, but common variations include stones of fortune (polished stones thrown onto a table that are read via their positioning), divination powder (powder dropped into liquid or thrown into fire, generating patterns or remains that the fortune teller interprets), and decks of divination (decks of cards, each with their own meaning, that are dealt onto a table to be interpreted).

Proficiency with fortune teller’s tools is required to attempt fortune telling. Proficiency with fortune teller’s tools allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make while using them. If you are proficient with the tools and are already adding your proficiency bonus to the ability check from a skill or other proficiency, then using the tools gives you advantage on the check instead.

* ***Insight.*** You can use fortune teller’s tools on Wisdom (Insight) checks that involve predicting how someone might behave in the future.

## Spren Information
A spren is a small sliver of the gods.  Each spren is a sentient creature with varying appearances, characteristics, and levels of intelligence.  There are thousands of different types of spren, each associated with a different type of phenomenon such as glory, ink, wind, anger, flames, cultivation, gravity, and many more.  There are a small subset of spren classified as True Spren which can form a Nahel Bond, which grants a creature the powers of surgebinding and allows them to join a Radiant Order.

Most spren can be viewed when events correlated to their type occur.  For example, windspren are visible on windy days, angerspren can be found rising from the ground around people who are angry, logicspren are more rare, but can appear around good and well thought out arguments.  The existence or non-existence of a spren around any given event is not directly correlated or indicative of the true nature of any situation, but generally events of certain types tend to attract their associated spren.

#### Roleplay Information for Spren
A spren is an creature who grants you your powers.  Each spren that chooses to connect and eventually form a Nahel Bond with a creature is a unique and sentient creature.  They have their own name, ideas, personalities, and feelings and are different for every Herald, even within the same order.

At third level you will gain the ability to physically manifest your spren.  You are not required to use this feature and you should talk to your DM about expectations for how your spren appears in the world.  Additionally, you should decide how much they will integrate into the story.  There are multiple ways you and your DM could roleplay the spren.  A spren could be a major character whom you talk to often and could have deep interesting personalities.  Conversely, if an additional constant NPC is too much work for your DM (which is completely valid), they could be realized as a spirit that lives within your shardblade speaking to you only when you speak your ideals, and remaining silent or speaking only when spoken to.  Or possibly, maybe you never see them at all and they come to you in your dreams and speak telepathically to you, but they have no visual manifestation.

Seriously, make sure to talk to your DM before playing your Herald to ensure that you are both on the same page about what to expect in terms of story and roleplay from your spren.

#### Beginning a Connection with a Spren
True Spren are attracted to creatures who exemplify the ideals of the order they are associated with.  When a True Spren finds a creature who they see as a capable candidate for becoming a surgebinder, they can begin to form a connection with that creature.  As you progress and begin to exemplify the tenets of the Knights Radiant, the spren will eventually reach out to you, often manifesting in the material plane near you, to offer you a [Nahel Bond](#nahel-bond).  Before you reach the state of achieving a Nahel Bond with a spren, you will begin to gain some benefits from stormlight as the spren's basic connection begins to empower your survivability and health.

Each Radiant Order requires a different spren, and the spren of your order is listed in the table below.

### Nahel Bond
When you are offered a Nahel Bond with a spren, you speak the [First Ideal of the Knights Radiant](#first-ideal) and form a powerful spiritual connection between you and your spren.  This connection once formed is not easily broken, and in doing so will kill the spren.

#### Breaking a Nahel Bond
At any time, a creature can choose to break their Nahel Bond with a spren.  But doing so is not a simple act, nor one that should be taken lightly.  When you break a Nahel Bond with a spren, the spren is killed and their soul turned [deadeye](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Deadeye), their corpse aimlessly wandering the Astral Sea for eternity.  You lose all features granted to you by the Herald Class and your Radiant Order subclass except for Hit Points, Proficiencies, and Equipment.  Additionally, you gain a Long-Term Madness as decided by your DM that is permanent and can only be cured by the Wish spell, or at your DM's discretion by reforming a Nahel Bond.

When you break a Nahel Bond, all spren are aware of this transgression against their kind and will likely never appear to you again, and it is extremely rare for any other True Spren to bond with you again, likely noting your history of killing your previous spren.  Talk to your DM about what options you may have for re-classing or creating a new character in the circumstances in which you Break your Nahel Bond.

#### Muting a Nahel Bond
Muting a Nahel Bond is typically caused by an external presence, forcing the spren to become muted, such as a specific anti-spren magic item, such as a suppression fabrial; or by an internal decision, intentional or not, to act in a manner contrary to the Oaths that they have sworn.

**External Factors:** When you are muted due to some external factor such as a spren suppression device (or an anti-magic field, or some other effect at your DM's discretion), you lose many of your features as a Herald and typically can no longer speak to your spren.  When you speak the 4th Ideal at 13th level, you and your spren become immune to the effects of anti-magic fields and other spren suppression devices as your bond is too strong to be separated.

Ending the muting caused by an external factor is typically only possible by either swearing the 4th ideal or by removing the source of the suppression (killing the beholder, destroying the suppression device)

The table below describes what features you have access to while you are Muted depending on your Radiant Order.

**Internal Factors:** When you are muted because of internal factors, the effects are typically more specific and can vary more drastically overtime at the discretion of your DM.

For example if you were to do something against your sworn ideals, on your first transgression you may not be muted at all, but receive a warning or a cry of pain from your Spren as you strain your Nahel Bond.  On future breaches of your Ideals, at your DM's discretion you may begin to become Muted as you lose features granted to you by the Herald Class and Radiant Order subclass.

If you are muted for a long enough period of time, or commit an act that breaks your ideals, especially one done without repentance can result in you [Breaking your Nahel Bond](#breaking-a-nahel-bond) with your spren.

At your DM's discretion, a muting caused by internal crisis' of faith, belief, hope or willingness to follow their ideals, doesn't have to result in a full muting of the heralds abilities, some ideas for how to begin to mute a herald are given below:
* Removing abilities granted by certain ideals, typically in reverse order of how they were earned
  * A Windrunner who has sword the third ideal and is becoming muted might lose some or all of their gravitational Adhesion abilities, only losing abilities granted by their second ideal if transgressions continue or repentance is not sought.
* The total amount of stormlight a herald could draw could be halved
* The amount regenerated by [Font of Stormlight](#font-of-stormlight) could be reduced or even eliminated.
* They could be unable to summon their shardblade
* They could have reduced or no healing from their Stormlight Regeneration ability.
* In the most tenuous of circumstances, one where the Bond is close to breaking permanently, all abilities as described in the table below could be muted.

| Order | Class features that can be used while Muted | Disabled class features while Muted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All Heralds | [Expertise](#expertise); Hit Points, Proficiencies, and Equipment granted by your Order | Communication with your Spren, [Stormlight Restoration](#stormlight-restoration), any abilities granted by your 1st, 2nd, or 3rd Ideal not listed below, [Shardblade](#shardblade), [Font of Stormlight](#font-of-stormlight) |
| Windrunners | [Weapon Mastery](#windrunner-weapon-mastery), [Fighting Style](#windrunner-fighting-style), Extra Attack granted by [Combat Prowess](#combat-prowess) | All other features |
| Skybreakers | [Weapon Mastery](#skybreaker-weapon-mastery), [Fighting Style](#windrunner-fighting-style), Extra Attack granted by [Ideal of Justice](#ideal-of-justice) | All other features |
| Dustbringers | [Weapon Mastery](#skybreaker-weapon-mastery), [Fighting Style](#windrunner-fighting-style), [Cantrips](#basic-surge-of-division) granted by Basic Surge of Division, Extra Attack granted by [Quick Division](#quick-division) | [Asheons](#asheons), [Fabrials](#fabrials), All other features |
| Edgedancer | [Elusive Defense](#elusive-defense), [Fighting Style](#edgedancer-fighting-style) | All other features |
| Truthwatcher | [Truthwatcher Cantrips](#truthwatcher-spellasting) | All other features |
| Lightweaver | [Lightweaver Cantrips](#lightweaver-spellcasting) | All other features |
| Elsecaller | [Elsecaller Cantrips](#elsecaller-spellcasting) | [Inkspren Archive](#inkspren-archive), All other features |
| Stoneward | [Weapon Mastery](#stoneward-weapon-mastery), [Fighting Style](#stoneward-fighting-style), Extra Attack granted by [Shifting Earth](#shifting-earth), [Vorin Stances](#vorin-stances), [Earthly Essence](#earthly-essence) | All other features |

*If you are of the 4th ideal or higher, you are immune to external sources of muting a described by your [Unbreakable Bond](#unbreakable-bond) feature.*

#### Reforming a Nahel Bond
There are two scenarios where you would reform a Nahel Bond.  When you have no current Nahel Bond and when you are repairing a muted Nahel Bond.

**Repairing a Muted Nahel Bond:** Some examples of methods to repair a muted Nahel bond are:
* Taking actions in accordance with your order's ideals
* Seeking guidance and absolution from another member of your order, or possibly a different order under the correct circumstances
* Traveling to a place of worship or divine power associated with your order if those exist and performing acts to rebuild trust.
* In examples of very tenuous or muted bonds, swearing a new ideal may be necessary in order to repair what has been broken.

**Reforming a New Nahel Bond:** Reforming a New Nahel bond after killing a previous Spren is extremely difficult and not something most spren would agree to for fear of their own life, or perhaps out of solidarity for their fallen sibling.

When you reform a New Nahel Bond it can be with either a new Spren or at your DM's discretion in notable circumstances, with a previously killed deadeye spren.  Typically if you were to reform with a deadeye spren it would be with the spren who you yourself killed.

The actions required to reform a new Nahel bond are very similar to the ones required to repair and muted nahel bond and form a Nahel Bond in the first place.  Assuming a spren finds you worthy enough of their Nahel Bond, you can reform a Nahel Bond.

At your DM's discretion, if you are at a higher level when you reform a new Nahel Bond, you may return to your Radiant Order while Muted instead of at full capacity.  Then as you swear your new ideals, regain your new abilities as if you were progressing through the order, while still keeping your hit points and proficiency bonus at levels respective to your herald level.

When you reform a new Nahel Bond, it does not need to be in the same Order as your previous Order, but if you choose a different order, you will need to recalculate your hit points and reassign proficiencies according to your new order.

## Attributions
I've tried to list sources and links next to the content I borrowed, was inspired by, or outright copied but I'll list them right here as well.

First off out of the way, I'm not trying to steal or claim credit for the original ideas of most of the theme of this class, or specific abilities where I mention I used another source of material.  I'm pleading the 'fair use' argument and continuing on the traditions of TTRPGs of, when you see something cool, you're free to take it and use it with proper attributions.  I don't see any value in re-inventing the wheel for certain features just for the sake of "originality".

Sources: 
* [Brandon Sanderson](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/)
  * Obviously, the class/subclass names and feature ideas, everything is inspired by the Stormlight Archive series that he's written.  I will argue my 5e implementation of said abilities is unique and my own (the game design element of it), but this project would not be possible without Sanderson's vision and world.  I love his stories and this is just how I want to spend more time thinking about his world.
* [The Coppermind](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Coppermind:Welcome)
  * An invaluable resource that I've used literally hundreds of times while writing up this class.
  * Specifically I will say many of the descriptions of spren and the radiant orders are often lifted word for word, or minorly re-worded entries from the coppermind.  Again, they've done a very good job of aptly describing these things, it seems silly to write it again just for the sake of originality.
  * Thank you Coppermind team and contributors, couldn't have created this without you.
* [The Surgebinder](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/kwjqhd/class_the_surgebinder_v30_join_the_knights/) by `u/xMartu`
  * For sparking my inspiration in going and creating this class.  I fell in love with the idea after seeing their creation of a 5e radiant knight.
  * I just had some different ideas about design than them so I decided to create my own as I felt I could do it better for how I envisioned it
  * Known similarities.  I don't know if I used them for inspiration or if I independently came up with the idea myself so I'm listing possible similarities here:
    * Herald 9th Level Windrunner Feature Full Lashing ~= Surgebinder 6th Level I'll protect those who can't protect themselves
    * Herald 13th Level Windrunner Feature: Shardplate ~= Surgebinder 14th Level Windrunner Protection Bulwark
    * Herald 6th & 9th Level Skybreaker Features: Clarity of Intent & Undeterred Conviction ~= Surgebinder 14th Level Skybreaker High Resilience
    * Herald 6th Level Lightweaver Malleable Illusions ~= Surgebinder 6th Level Lightweaver Malleable Illusions
      * Pretty sure we both just took this from 5e's Illusion wizard feature of the same name lol.
    * Herald 13th Level Elsecaller Shadesmar Hideaway ~= Surgebinder 14th Level Elsecaller Realmatic Conjunction
      * We probably both were inspired by RoW's introduction of Jasnah having a boat in Shadesmar where she could go if she was hurt or in danger, but including here just as a note for their similarity.
    * The Lecture spell is at least in name a copy from xMartu's Surgebinder
* [Erin Roberts'](http://linktr.ee/erinroberts) article in MCDM's [Arcadia 30](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/arcadia/products/arcadia-complete-bundle-issues-1-30)
  * I was inspired by it then realized that they just had better rules than I could've written so I've used it with attribution.
* [u/arllll on r/dndnext](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/d7uyq0/homebrew_weapon_attack_cantrips_in_the_vein_of/)
  * I knowingly went out to see if anybody had created any good gish-style melee weapon cantrip spells and *u/arllll* had, so I took them, slightly modified some of them and have linked them here.  Thank you.

## Changelog

### v0.7.3
#### Herald Class
* At 3rd level you can now manifest your spren via the Find Familiar spell, once per long rest.
  * This is a change from the original intent where spren would not be strategically useful.  I've decided to reverse that decision as spren are a core part of the class and it's not a large power spike.

#### General Changes:
* Spell lists have been modified for a number of classes
* Edgedancer
  * Removed some spells that overlapped too heavily and didn't feel right
* Elsecaller
  * Removed stone based spells as those are for stoneward
  * Added a few new spells from phb 2024
* Lightweaver
  * Got a few charm spells
  * Removed some divine and arcane spells that don't make sense
* Stoneward
  * Got more stone-based spells they can use at certain levels
* Truthwatcher
  * Got many of the new healing spells which moved into abjuration (from evocation) along with a few divination spells
* Windrunner
  * Got Reverse Gravity and Jallarzi's storm of radiance as they are gravity and storm based spells

### v0.7.2
#### General Changes
* Modified organization of files on the backend to make development easier

### v0.7.1
#### General Changes
* Formatting of headers and order of some headers

#### Dustbringer Order
* Organized spell List into table instead of long list
* Added rules for muting in main herald document

#### Edgedancer Order
* Got Weapon Masteries!  They originally didn't have them and that doesn't make sense because they're a half-caster they deserve masteries!

### v0.7.0
#### General Changes
* New Order: Dustbringer!

#### Dustbringer Order
* An intelligence half-caster based around destruction and creating weapon augments called asheons which temporarily improve weapons before slowly breaking down over time
* Added new Divison Spell which is a Dustbringer specific spell.

#### Lightweaver Order
* Gained the option for proficiency in poisoner's kit at level 1
* Lost the Gust cantrip as that wasn't an intended lightweaver spell.

### v0.6.1
#### General Changes
* Changelog header size has been decreased by 1 across the board (H1's are now H2's) so that the changelog can be placed within the herald markdown view on the website
* Changelog and last-edited fields are now viewable on the website
* The spells Lecture has been added as it was missed earlier
* Across multiple orders, the Improved Interceptor fighting style has been slightly reworded
* Minor formatting fixes across multiple orders
* The layout of the Herald section of the markdown file has been reordered to put most of the complicated spren rules near the bottom of the document in order to keep the regular class rules more concise, they've also been expanded upon

#### Stoneward Order
* The number of vorin stances known no longer comes to include every stance.  This is because I'm deciding to follow the class design of other "similar" subclasses like Battlemaster where the character has to make a decision on which one they want.  Giving out every single stance I believe almost gives too many options, and by reducing the total, it will make the gameplay easier and more fun.
* Shardplate got a buff lasting until next rest, not for 1 hour an was also reworded to be more clear
* Infusions can now be changed over a short or long rest but cost 2 stormlight to do so



### v0.6.0
#### General Changes
* All of the subclass features have headers underneath them with the level the feature is unlocked to make it easier to understand what levels grant what class features.
* New Custom Tools Section Added
  * Includes Fortune Telling Tools which are used by Truthwatchers
* The Vorin Stances section had some sections re-written to clarify rules
  * Lifestance has its shields rules re-written to clarify ruling on dual wielding shields
  * Also had its Infused properties fixed to work with Windrunner's features
  * Also fixed a bug in the wording which would've allowed a creature to use two reactions against the same attack.  With updated wording it is now more clear that you can only use Protector or Improved Interceptor fighting style against a single attack, not both.
  * Added a table of what weapons work with what masteries to the bottom of the document for easy reference.

#### Elsecaller Order
* Added 18th level ability Shadesmar Storm
  * Always prepared spell Shadesmar Storm which randomly deals damage to enemies and grants temp hp to allies

#### Herald Class
* Added Early Subclass links to Dustbringer, Willshaper and Bondsmith
  * (Not completed yet)
* Added link to completed Truthwatcher order
* Started work on Dustbringer, Willshaper and Bondsmith
* Cleaned Up definition of Order Ability Score vs Order Modifier
* Reworked 20th level capstone ability to become Stormlight Soul
  * Instead of constantly regenerating stormlight which could cause large power spikes to some subclasses (such as elsecaller), instead it now grants a 1/long rest the ability to gain 20 stormlight as a BA which is more balanced while still fulfilling the goal of giving the player more stormlight.
* Added Attributions Section at the bottom of the document

#### Truthwatcher Order
* A new subclass The Truthwatcher! is released in this version
* It is a full caster intelligence or wisdom caster who knows many abjuration and divination spells and can cast a few spells from other classes
* They use their powers to heal, see the future, and use their foresight to protect their allies.
* It might be very OP, or it might be alright, won't know until it is playtested more.

#### Windrunner Order
* Buffed Dexterous protector to scale based on what ideal you were on, instead of just having the range you can protect from jump from 5 to 30ft at the 4th ideal.
* Cleaned up some bad formatting
* Cleaned up 4th ideal feature Resonant Shardplate
* Buffed Dexterous Protector improvement gained at 13th level to allow the windrunner the ability to "buy" reactions for dexterous protector using stormlight
  * In my playtesting this class, one reaction spent a turn protecting was cool and all, but having to be within 5 feet AND using your one reaction for disadvantage was kinda trash and didn't make me feel like I was "protecting" so these buffs are intended to at pre-13th level, make it easier for the windrunner to protect (by increasing the range) an then at 13th level, become a god at protecting in a multitude of ways.

### v0.5.2
#### Elsecaller
* Fixed and cleaned up spellcasting table for elsecaller

### v0.5.1
#### Fixed issues with links and removed outdated TODOs in Elsecaller

### v0.5.0
#### Herald Class

* Added statements of purpose and brief description to each class in subclass link table
* Shardblade can now be used as arcane focus 
* Added Elsecaller Order

#### Windrunner Order
* Moved Resonance to 9th level with DM approval, other classes get teleportation at this level, only seemed fair to give opportunity to windrunners as well.
* Added *Resonant Shardplate* ability as 4th ideal ability
  * Grants resonance at 13th level if it wasn't allowed at 9th
  * Grants ***NEW*** Shardplate ability which allows you to protect allies within 60 feet of you by increasing their AC, additionally it grants an improvement to *Dexterous Protector*, and *Empowered Flight*

#### Skybreaker Order
* Removed Skylancer fighting style, replaced it with protection, skylancer was never intended, and protection, while unlikely to be used is still an option.
* Clarified rolls for *Conditional Justice*
* Reworked *Conditional Justice* table to make it render better and simplify view
* Slight buff of effective range at higher levels to *Gravitational Law* feature.
* Actually linked to Hand of Judgement Spell in capstone feature

#### Edgedancer Order
* Renamed Unarmored Defense to Elusive Defense

#### Lightweaver Order
* Fix for 19th and 20th levels of lightweaver spellcasting table, had listed wrong number of 5th level spells.
* Added footnote for *Body of Lies*

#### Elsecaller Order
***BRAND NEW ORDER***
* powerful mage class who has an incredible spell list, 
  * but at higher levels begins losing lower level spell slots to power their higher level ones, the intent is to keep the total number of spells they can cast in check thus eliminating or reducing shield / absorb elements spam which is common at higher levels, instead forcing them to use 2nd, 3rd, or 4th level slots in order to cast shield.
* 2nd ideal allows for some small spell slot regeneration capabilities
* 3rd ideal allows for shardblade wielding gish play-style temporarily
* 4th ideal allows for life-saving teleportation to predetermined safe location.
* 5th ideal TBD

#### General Changes
* Fixed MANY spelling mistakes

### v0.4.1
#### New Format
* Class information is now hosted at: https://nickarlovich.github.io/dnd/homebrew/herald
* All future releases will be shown here as its easier to distribute and maintain rather than developing pdf's.  In future, it might be converted to a nicer looking pdf for download.

#### Herald Class
* Minor formatting changes
* Added links to Spren via Coppermind
* Modified order sections appear, subclasses are now above items/weapons/stances/oils etc.

#### Edgedancer Order
* Minor formatting
* Spell list is now in table form for more compact viewing

#### Lightweaver Order
* Minor formatting
* spells are listed in 2 tables of 5 columns wide for more compact viewing

#### Stoneward Order
* Minor Formatting
* Named 18th level ability One with the Earth

#### Windrunner Order
* Minor formatting
* Renamed 18th level ability from Nahel Bond to Herald of the Highstorm
  * Nahel bond applies to all radiants, not just windrunners, doesn't make sense to make it the windrunner 18th level ability name.

#### Custom Weapons/Stances/Spells
* Skylance had minor formatting changes
* Skylance had minor wording changes to explain it works while airborne in any capacity, not just if they have a fly speed.
* Vorin stances had minor formatting changes
* Weapon mastery had very minor table error fixed


### v0.4.0
#### Herald Class
* Added link to Skybreaker subclass
* Added Hand of Judgment Spell, for use by Skybreaker order
* Switched Order Ability Score of Windrunner to Dexterity

#### Edgedancer Order
* Fixed typo in Slip from the Mind

#### Skybreaker Order
* Added new Skybreaker order (in progress)
* Martial subclass which focuses around laws, and codes, and then using that power in order to smite enemies who break those laws.

#### Stoneward Order
* Moved text about Ready for Battle feature from Stoneward subclass to Vorin Stances section, as it applies to all vorin stances, not just for the Stoneward subclass

#### Windrunner Order
* Switched Order Ability Score to Dexterity
  * Monk's suffered the same design problem by splitting the two DCs so intrinsically, why would we continue to spread the martial/caster divide by making martials MAD while casters only SAD.  Make's a little less sense, but balance wise, its much better and its easily reflavored to dexterity imo.  Now a windrunner can be Int, Wis, or Cha focused, rather than being shoe-horned into Wis.
* This now means the following abilities scale off Dexterity instead of wisdom
  * Windrunner DC
    * Full Lashing (Magnify Gravity and Immovable Object spells)
    * Nahel Bond (Pulse Wave, and 1/turn ability)
  * Improved Interceptor fighting style
  * Stormlight tempo uses per short rest
  * Reverse Lashing AC bonus
* Granted the Vorin Stance Lifestance to Windrunners at 13th level.

#### Herald Class
* Added weapon mastery table
* Added vorin stances descriptions

* Ranged shardblade weapons automatically generate ammunition if required.
* Weapons absorbed into the shardblade gain the benefits of Awakened, Ascendant, Exalted if they don't already have those properties.

#### Edgedancer Order
* Finished up development on Edgedancer subclass (version 1, may tweak based on feedback).  Added capstone (18th level) ability.

#### Stoneward Order
* Developed the stoneward order which who is designed around themes of stone and dependability.  It is a martial class which has stances that the combatants can use to adapt to any situation.  

#### Windrunner Order
* Added OneDND Weapon Mastery to Windrunner class
* Removed trident as a learned weapon for Windrunner's
* Updated Skylance with Mastery property
* Added implied ruling that dexterity could be used on all types of proficient weapons for windrunners
* Upgraded Improved Interceptor for windrunners so that it doesn't collide with Dexterous Protector
* Nahel Bond's windstorm no longer is centered on the windrunner allowing them to move around the windstorm.  Otherwise a 90ft move speed isn't that useful when you can only really move up or down without moving the highstorm with you.
* Can now also move the highstorm up to 30ft at the beginning of your turn.

#### Lightweaver Order
* Fixed typo in footnotes
* Fixed typos in descriptions

### v0.2.2

#### Edgedancer Order
* Begin Development on the Edgedancer subclass (not finished), an order who focuses on healing allies and remembering the value of a life.  They are known for getting to know everyone they meet and bringing health, joy and good harvests to the cities they frequent.

#### Lightweaver Order
* Fixed Typo
* Clarified wording of Intimate Riposte

#### Windrunner Order
* Fixed Typo
* Windrunners can now use dex for non-finesse weapons
  * This was always an intended feature, but it wasn't explicitly stated, so now it is!
  * This feature is essentially the same as a Monk's martial arts fighting style
* Upgraded Improved Interception feature so that it doesn't clash with the given Protector feature (now named Dexterous Protector) as they both required a reaction to use, so it was clunky, now if you want to protect, you can actually protect properly which is the point of the fighting style.

#### Herald Class
* Added Link to Edgedancer Order

### v0.2.1

#### Lightweaver Order
* Introduced the Lightweaver Subclass, an order of the Knights Radiant who focus on creating powerful and intricate illusions to distract, enthrall and attack their foes!
* Created Illusory Onslaught Spell, a damaging illusion spell attack cantrip for lightweavers.
* Created Army of the Mind, an extremely powerful spell representing the ability to summon an army of illusory figures who can help protect allies.


#### Windrunner Order
* Corrected Lore on Honorspren, they are the children of honor, not the splinters of honor, splinters imply that honor was destroyed to create the children.
* Updated Skylancer fighting technique wording to only apply effects on your turn (which is the intent), there could be some tomfoolery on other turns.
* Minor grammar changes to Windrunner and Skylance

#### Herald Class
* Added Link to Lightweaver subclass
* Added New Spells section to class documentation
* Added Footnotes Section to the bottom of document with headers for spell notes, weapon notes, and class notes.

### v0.1.2

#### Herald Class
* Expertise moved to 6th level, 13th level is just too far into the game that it may never come up.
* Stormlight veins:
  * Gained an ability at 14th level to give all characters advantage on STR/DEX/CON saving throws, might be a bit strong.  Possibly in the future make it cost a charge or something.
  * No longer takes an action to reveal/conceal/activate stormlight veins, it was already so niche, it didn't need a stormlight cost.
* Summoning a shardblade now only takes an interact object instead of an action, it's pretty dumb that it costs an action in general.
* Gave the ability to use a magic weapon in place of a shardblade which is a buff and allows heralds to benefit from other magical weapons.

### v0.1

#### Herald Class
Introduced the Herald Class

#### Windrunner Order
Introduced the Windrunner Subclass

[^herald1]: [Herald 1]: Many of the orders are balanced around them only gaining certain weapon proficiencies.  If a radiant knight with light armour was able to gain longbow proficiency and heavy armor, the character's power level would be much higher than expected.  Obviously, as with all rules in D&D you are allowed to ignore them if your DM approves.  But consider this, there is a reason that I've removed certain armour and weapon proficiencies, and its because each class (should) be fun and balanced to play without those things.

[^herald2]: [Herald 2]: While there are instances of spren in the story giving help to characters (like Shallan using pattern as way to overhear conversations, or mimic speech), they create massive balancing headaches and so none of the classes are built around using them.  If your DM wants to include them, they may, but that is their decision and burden.<!-- <p id="windrunner1"></p> -->

[^windrunner1]: [Windrunner 1]: Not that you could use the extra attacks anyways as the skylance forbids making any additional attacks during the same turn it is used.

 <!-- <a href="#windrunner1b">↩︎</a> -->

<!-- <p id="windrunner2"></p> -->

[^windrunner2]: [Windrunner 2]: Alternative wordings include: *"I will protect even those I hate, even if the one I hate most is myself"*, and *"I've got to protect people, you know? Even from myself."*  The words you speak don't need to exactly match the words listed here, the third windrunner ideal focuses on protecting others despite one's caveats.

[^windrunner3]: [Windrunner 3]: If your concentration is broken while casting Wind Walk, the spell fails, but you don't lose any charges, similar in spirit to the rules for Longer Casting Times (Players Handbook page 202)

<!-- <p id="windrunner3"></p> -->

[^windrunner4]: [Windrunner 4]: At this time, we don't know what the 5th ideal is but I'm just putting final ideal in here so if your character gets to say the 5th ideal there is something here.

<!-- <p id="skybreaker1"></p> -->

[^skybreaker1]: [Skybreaker 1]: Also known as the Ideal of Crusade, it requires that a skybreaker undertake a personal quest and complete it to the satisfaction of their highspren. In this case, Szeth from the Stormlight Archive books takes up his oath to kill the leaders of his old civilization who banished and made him truthless (essentially a slave) for foretelling a true future they didn't wish to know.

<!-- <a href="#skybreaker1b">↩︎</a> -->

[^dustbringer1]: [Dustbringer 1]: Pronounced like ash-shea-on. (it's a play on ash (from a dustbringer's ashspren) and Seon, from elantris).  There's no term for a fabrial attached to a mundane weapon in the stormlight series so I've elected to call a "fabrial" before it's attached to a weapon an *asheon* so that dnd rules can be clearly written.

[^dustbringer2]: [Dustbringer 2]: Some examples of "meaningfully using your fabrial outside of combat" could be using the Dimensional Hatchet feature of a handaxe in order to teleport through a wall, using a skylance to fly, or a whips infused grapple property to stop a target from fleeing.

[^dustbringer3]: [Dustbringer 3]: I'm aware that this is a really lame capstone ability.  It's a placeholder for now, while it's powerful, it's not very flavorful or unique.  Pray that Knights of Wind and Truth gives us more insight into high level division and abrasion surges.

[^truthwatcher1]: [Truthwatcher 1]: Rules for inspiration can be found on page 143 of the PHB.  In short, when you make a d20 check, before you roll you can choose to use inspiration to gain advantage on that roll.  You can only have one inspiration at a time.

<!-- <p id="lightweaver1"></p> -->

[^lightweaver1]: [Lightweaver 1]: Some examples of "truths" from the Stormlight Archives.
    Example 1: Shallan in the corner of her visions began to see creepy shapes appearing in the corners of her vision that continued to follow her.  Eventually she was cornered in her room and the creatures were closing in on her when one of them spoke to her, "What are you" to which she responds "What am I? I'm terrified" which on its surface makes sense because she's scared of the monster's in her vision but also, it relates to her drawing abilities, her naivety towards trying to save her family, and trying to steal from a powerful scholar.  She's been putting on a facade of a scholar, of somebody who her brothers can count on to save their family, as somebody who knows what she's doing, when in reality, she's over her head, on the path to destruction and failure, and ultimately, terrified which is a powerful truth about the fact that she isn't who she wants to be and who she needs to be for her family and for herself.

    Example 2: The second truth Shallan spoke was "I killed my father" which is pretty self explanatory.  When she was younger, she killed her father.  Killing her father meant the end of her family, as her mother didn't work and he did all the deals to keep their estate alive, and to keep the debtor's from swooping in.  Now that she'd killed him, as terrible a man he was, she'd just doomed her family to death by the bad people who'd they'd borrowed money from.  So her saying "I killed my father" not only is literally about the fact that she killed somebody, but also relates to the fact that she is the reason that her family is in ruin, which is something that she hasn't acknowledged or really come to terms with.

[^lightweaver2]: [Lightweaver 2]: This is another situation where player creativity can be encouraged beyond the given example.  If your lightweaver is a potter, they could build a false statue that is destroyed in the same moment, instead of a visual illusion.  Or if they were a musician, they could play a note or chord to cause the attack to miss.  Point is, make these abilities yours, and sculpt them to fit your lightweaver, don't be limited by my singular examples given here.[^elsecaller1]: [Elsecaller 1]: See the rules for Casting A Spell At a Higher Level on page 100 of the [SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2023/downloads/dnd/SRD_CC_v5.1.pdf) or Page 201 of the PHB.

[^elsecaller2]: [Elsecaller 2]: For example if at the end of a short rest, you chose to expend 5 stormlight to restore one of your missing 3rd level spell slots, you could not then take a second short rest and choose to expend 3 more stormlight to regain a 2nd level spell slot in addition to the 3rd level spell slot you regained on the previous rest.

    Said another way, you can only have one regained spell slot from the Stormlight Exchange feature at any given time.

[^elsecaller3]: [Elsecaller 3]: This does mean you could restore a 1st level spell slot even when you may not have one naturally.  For example, an 8th level elsecaller doesn't have any available 1st level spell slots but they could regain one through this feature.. but they could not gain a 5th level spell slot because they don't have the power to cast 5th level spells (nor do they meet the level requirement for this feature).  *You always contain the power to cast 1st level spells at 1st level, but possibly not the spell slots*

<!-- <p id="stoneward1"></p> -->

[^stoneward1]: [Stoneward 1]: You can use whatever definition of Tremorsense (dnd5e, oneDND, homebrew) that you'd like, but I'd suggest the following:
    **Tremorsense**: A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of moving creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it's detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.

    Tremorsense can't detect creatures or objects in the air, and Tremorsense doesn't count as a form of sight.

    If a creature is hidden when you try to sense them with Tremorsense, a contested stealth check is made between the hidden creature's stealth roll and the perceiver's passive perception, if the hiding creature gained a bonus to their stealth roll due to a visual obscuration (such as invisibility or fog cloud), the hidden creature's roll takes a -5 penalty,  If the perceiver's passive perception is greater than the stealth roll the hidden creature made to become hidden, then the hidden creature loses the hidden status, and the perceiver knows the hider's location.

<!-- <p id="stoneward2"></p> -->

[^stoneward2]: [Stoneward 2]: Note, while earth gliding you can still cast spells, so if you were to earthglide into a castle basement, you wouldn't be able to get through the wall as it is worked stone.  But you could cast Meld Into Stone, or Stone Shape to get past.
<!-- <a href="#stoneward2b">↩︎</a> -->




<!-- <p id="illusory_onslaught1"></p> -->

[^illusory_onslaught1]: [Illusory Onslaught 1]: Your illusion could be anything that you could think of.  They could be a pack of blood-thirsty dogs, sharp knives, bolts of fire, a well thought out logical argument, a voodoo doll you carved and now stab/burn, a blanket you wove that you distract with before you punch them, a fortune telling device that always comes up deadly.  Use your imagination and creation skills as a lightweaver to make your attacks unique.
